Nauck favours F. W. Schmidt’s proposal
to write ἐσθλοῦ irpbs ἀνδρός, and
quotes in its support Choricius Gaz. p. 17
ἐσθλοῦ γὰρ ἀνδρός, ἡ τραγῳδία φησίν,
ἅπαντα φέρειν καλῶς. Emphasis certainly
seems to require that order : cf. Ai. 1071
καίτοι κακοῦ πρὸς ἀνδρὸς ἄνδρα δημότην
μηδὲν δικαιοῦν κτἑ. Eur. fr. 28. Schmidt
adds a long list of examples. But the
reverse order is natural and correct in fr.
79, where see n. for πρός c. gen. in this
sense. The sentiment is adapted from
the current proverbial philosophy: cf.
Theogn. 657 μηδὲν ἄγαν χαλεποῖσιν ἀσῶ

ἀγαθοῦ. Pind. Pyth. 3. 82 τὸ μὲν ὦν

There does not appear to be any
necessity for changing the text. Cer-
P. II.
tainly there is no probability in such wild
conjectures as Heimsoeth's ἐν Διὸς κήποις
δροῦσι μοῦνον ἄνδρες ὄλβιοι, and Week
lein's ἐν Διὸς κάποις δρέπεσθαι μοῦνον
ἀνδρὸς ὀλβίου, or in R. Ellis's ἀροῦται

<pb n="2"/>
μοῦνον εὐδαίμων λοβός, which Campbell
rashly adopts. Even if ἀροῦσθαι were
indefensible, ’s apveadat (i.e. ἐν Διὸς
κήποισι &#x003C;γὰρ ἔστ᾿&#x003E; ἀρύεσθαι |
ὄλβους: see his Kl. Schriften, 11
712) would be no improvement. Dieterich
(Nekyia, p. 21) suggested εὐδαίμονος
ὁλκούς, i. e. ‘only the blest may
plough ’ ; but furrows are out of place
in a garden.</p>
<p>Διὸς κήποις probably refers to the
garden of the Hesperides, also known as
the garden of Hera (Callira. h. Αrί. 164
Pherecyd. fr. 33 a [FHG 1 79]), or the
garden of Oceanus (Ar. Nub. 271 Ὠκεανοῦ
πατρὸς ἐν κήποις ἱερὸν χορὸν ἵστατε
Νύμφαις). This was by some authorities
placed in the extreme north (see on fr.
956), but most commonly in the west
beyond the stream of Oceanus. Here
were grown the golden apples which
Ge presented to Hera on the occasion of
her marriage with Zeus : Pherecyd. l.c.
(Eratosth. catast. 3) ὅτε ἐγαμεῖτο ἡ Ἥραὑπὸ
Διός, φεόντων αὐτῇ τῶν θεῶν δῶρα,
τὴν Γῆν ἐλθεῖν φέρουσαν τὰ χρύσεα μῆλα·</p>
<p>ἰδοῦσαν δὲ τὴν Ἥραν θαυμάσαι, καὶ εἰπεῖν
καταφυτεῦσαι ε'ς τὸν τῶν θεῶν
κῆπον, ὃς ἦν παρὰ τῷ Ἄτλαντι. The
spaced words serve to illustrate the
present passage, more particularly if we
suppose that the apples were treated by
Sophocles as symbolical of happiness.

Σοφοκλῆς ἰονι. κείμενος μὲν βουστάδας

name of the play was read by Musurus
as Ἴωνι, and Μ. Schmidt suggested
Σίνωνι; but Dindorf’s view that Οἰνεῖ
was intended by the corrector deserves
consideration (see Nauck on Eur. fr. 407).</p>
<p>1 χειμῶνος. In the winter season
the herds graze in the home meadows or
shelter in the byres, but in the summer
they are driven away to range over the
hills. H. defends his brilliant emendation
by quoting O. T. 1138 (the shepherd
brings his flocks down from the mountains
in September) χειμῶνα δ᾿ ἤδη
τ’ εἰς ἔπαυλ' ἐγὼ Ι ἤλαυνον ὗτός τ’ ἐς τὰ
Λαΐου σταθμά. Dion Chrys. 7. 13 τότε
μὲν δὴ ἐξ ἀνάγκης αὐτοῦ κατεμείναμεν,
οὑπερ ἐτύχομεν τὰς βοῦς ἔχοντες καί τινας
σκηνὰς πεποιημένοι καὶ αὐλὴν διὰ ξύλων οὐ
μεγάλην οὐδὲ ἰσζυράν, μόσχων ἕνεκεν, ὡς
ἂν οἶμαι πρὸς αὐτό που τὸ θέρος. τοῦ
μὲν γὰρ χειμῶνος ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις ἐνέμομεν,
νομὴν ἱκανὴν ἔχοντες καὶ πολὺν χιλὸν ἀποκείμενον·
τοῦ δὲ θέρους ἀπηλαύνομεν εἰς τὸ
ορη.</p>
<p>2 χερσεύει. The text of Hesychius
is corrupt or defective, but it seems
certain that χερσεύει must have been
used by Sophocles in the passage cited.
I agree therefore with Dindorf in thinking
that it dropped out after αὐλάς, but not
in assuming the loss of other words as
well. χερσεύειν is a rare word, but the
sense in which Sophocles was most
likely to employ it is ‘to be om dry
land' : so Eur. fr. 636, 3 τὸν παῖδα χερσεύειν
μόρος (Dobree's correction seems
certain). Plut. soll. an. 33 p. 982 B
ἐπῳάζειν δὲ μὴ δυναμένη μηδὲ χερσεύειν.
The ace. αὐλάς would then resemble Phil.
144 τόπον. . . ὅντινα κεῖται, Eur. Suppl. 987
τί ποτ' αἰθερίαν ἔστηΚε πέτραν ; and other
instances quoted by Kuehner-Gerth 1
314. Since, however, Philostr. iun.

<pb n="3"/>
can be adduced in support of the meaning
to come to land,’ we must not exclude
the possibility that αὐλάς was ace. termini.
H. was inclined to regard ἐπὶ
χέρσου as a remnant of the Sophoclean
text, and consequently to read περιχερσεύει
or ἐπιχερσεύει (so Toup). But this would
not agree with the lemma of Hesychius,
and I should prefer to suppose the words
to be part of the explanation, qualifying
a verb — οἰκεῖ or βαίνει — which has disappeared.
The gloss διὰ χειρῶν ἔχει is
due to the fact that χέρσος was sometimes
derived from χεόρ: Etgni. Μ.
p. 809, 7 χέρσος, ἡ γῆ, ἐξ ἧς ἔστι χερσὶ
προσάπτεσθαι. Thus Hesychius would
have given three renderings of the verb,
‘dwells on dry land, or manages,
merely ’ Welcker proposed βουστάδος
αὐλῆς ἔπι χερσεύει, and Ellendt
made the same suggestion.</p>
<p>322</p>
<lg><l>ἀξέστους</l></lg>
<p>322 Hesych. 1 p. 220 ἀξέστους· τραχείας.
Σοφοκλῆς σιών.</p>
<p>The name of the play was conjectured
to be Σίνωνι by Musurus, and Ἴωνι by
Schow, whom Nauck follows. Μ.
Schmidt urges that the position of the
accent points to Οἰνώνῃ : but that title is
otherwise unknown, although it might
have covered a reference to the Ἀλέξανδρος.
Dindorf agreed with Musurus.</p>
<p>The word occurs again in O. C. 019.
The gender of the gloss perhaps indicates
that the substantive to be supplied is
πετρας.</p>
<p>ΚΑMΙΚOΙ</p>
<p>Herodotus (7. 169, 170) refers to the story of the violent
death of Minos at Camicus when he went to Sicily in his search
for Daedalus, but gives no details. For these we have to go to
other authorities.</p>
<p>After the death of his son Icarus, Daedalus continued his
flight and arrived safely at Camicus, where he was received by
the Sicanian king Cocalus, and soon became a welcome inmate
of his household. Meanwhile Minos pursued him relentlessly,
and in every place to which he came produced a spiral shell,
promising a large reward to anyone who should succeed in
threading it ; for he thought that in this way he would discover
Daedalus. When he showed the shell to Cocalus, in whose
palace Daedalus was concealed, the king undertook to perform
the task and afterwards gave the shell to Daedalus. Daedalus
bored a hole in the shell, and fastening a thread to an ant waited
until the ant had passed from one end to the other. Minos,
finding his puzzle solved, felt sure that no one but Daedalus
possessed the necessary cunning, and at once demanded his
surrender. Cocalus promised to comply with his wishes, and
offered him the usual hospitalities of the age. Daedalus, however,
had so endeared himself to the king’s daughters by his
artistic skill that they determined to prevent the surrender

<pb n="4"/>
of their favourite to his enemy, and contrived the death of Minos
by pouring boiling pitch over him when they attended him in
the bath. Such is the version of Zenob. 4. 92 (Paroem. I
which is practically identical with Apollod. epit. 1. 13 — 15, with
the exception that Apollodorus mentions another account substituting
boiling water for the pitch. The latter alternative, as we
learn from schol. Horn. B 145, was derived from Philostephanus
(FHG 111 31) and Callimachus in the Αἴτια (fr. 5 Sch.), and
through Callimachus no doubt passed to Ovid (Ib. 290). An
additional detail is mentioned by schol. Find. Nem. 4. 95 (59),
where Daedalus is said to have invented a contrivance for
carrying the water through a pipe in the roof so as to fall on
Minos’s head. The agency of the daughters, but without any
detailed explanation of their treachery, is recorded also by
Hygin. fab. 44, Conon 25, Pausan. 7. 4. 6 1, and schol. Find.
Pyth. 6. 5. Diodorus, who as usual converts the myth into a
semblance of history, makes Daedalus the engineer of Cocalus,
who constructs for him an impregnable fortress. Minos then
invades Sicily, but Cocalus entraps him by proposing a friendly
conference, and then suffocates him with the steam of the bathroom
(4. 78, 79). But long before his time Cocalus and the
invasion of Minos had become a part of the stock-in-trade of
the historians as an indispensable element in the narrative of the
Greek colonization of Sicily: see Fhilistus fr. 1 (FHG I
Arist. pol. 2. 10. 1271 b 39, Strabo 273, 279, Diod. 12. 71, Heraclid.
Font. 29 (FHG 11 220).</p>
<p>Fr. 324 leaves no doubt that the story of Sophocles was the
same as that which is preserved in Apollodorus. Wagner (Epit.
Vat p. 132) inferred that Apollodorus derived his material from
the ὑπόθεσις of Sophocles' play 2, and the conclusion would be
much more convincing than it is, if there were better reasons
than those given by Nauck for assigning fr. 325 to Sophocles.
But whether boiling pitch or some other instrument was employed
by the daughters in compassing the destruction of Minos
matters little ; in other respects, the main features of the plot
are securely fixed by the general agreement of the authorities.
The play was possibly known also by the alternative title
Minos, to which there is a solitary reference by Clement of
Alexandria (fr. 407) The usual title, wrongly altered to Καμίκιοι
by Brunck, indicates that the chorus consisted of citizens of
Camicus, one of the few places in Sicily which are definitely
known as Sicanian settlements. The site is usually located in
the neighbourhood of Agrigentum between that town and Minoa,
<note type="footnote">1 Inycus is mentioned in place of Camicus: hut see 10. 17. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 He is followed by Robert in Pauly-Wissowa IV 2001.</note>

<pb n="5"/>
but, according to more recent researches, it was further to the
north, among the mountains which rise inland above the baths
of Selinus 1.</p>
<p>The story was exploited by the Dorians of Crete as a justification
for their colonizing movement, in the course of which
they occupied the south coast of Sicily, and it may therefore
be dated at least as early as the foundation of Gela in 689.
Recently, however, an attempt has been made by Bethe 2 to
show that the story of the tragic death of Minos at Camicus
contains a substratum of historical truth, representing the emigration
to Sicily of fragments of the Kefti people from Crete,
which may be assumed to have taken place about 1200 B.C.
The legend is confirmed by the archaeological discoveries of
Minoan pottery in Sicily, and by the names Daidalion and
Minoa given to pre-Hellenic settlements.</p>

<p>Daedalus, accoiding to one of the
stories told in connexion with him, was
an Athenian who was obliged to go into
exile, having been condemned for homicide
by the council of the Areopagus.
This was his reason for seeking the court
of Minos. The murder was committed
thus: his sister’s son Talos (Hellanicus
[FHG I 56] ap. schol. Eur. Or. 1648
al.), or Calos (Pausan. 1. 21. 4. al. ),
was his rival in ingenuity, and had invented
the saw by observation of a snake’s
jawbone ; Daedalus was jealous, and
fearing to be put in the shade threw him
over the cliffs of the Acropolis. According
to Apollodorus (3. 214) and
others, Perdix was the sister of Daedalus,
who hanged herself in grief for her son’s
death (Phot. Suid. l.c.). Other authorities
(Ov. Met. 8. 255, Hygin. fab. 39
244, 274, Serv. on Verg. Georg. 1. 143
Aen. 6. 14, schol. Ov. Ib. 498) agree
with Sophocles in giving the name Perdix
to the nephew himself. It is not clear
whether Πέρδικος ἱερόν and τάφος Τάλω
(Lucian Pisc. 42) were one and the same
spot, but the account of Pausanias shows
that the grave of Talos was, as we should
expect, close to the foot of the Acropolis.
Robert in Pauly-Wissowa IV 1997 finds
it difficult to understand how Sophocles
was able to ignore the tradition attaching
to the grave of Talos, or to re-christen
the site ; and similar doubts are expressed
by Gruppe in Bursian’s Jahresb. CXXXVII
619, criticizing ’s attempt (Die
Sage von Daidalos, Leipzig 1902) to show
that Calos rather than Talos was the
name known to the version of the legend
adopted by Hellanicus. The evidence is
insufficient for the solution of such problems;
but it is possible that contradictory
<note type="footnote">1 Freeman, Sicily, I</note>
<note type="footnote">2 Rhein. Mus. LXV (1910) 200 — 232.</note>

<pb n="6"/>
stories were connected with the two
sanctuaries, and were already current in
Sophocles’ time. We cannot even safely
assert that in Sophocles the invention of
the saw was suggested to Perdix by the
backbone of a fish, as Holland infers
from the accounts of Ovid and the others
whom he supposes to derive from Sophocles;
for the incident formed no part of
the action of the play, and probably only
received a brief mention in the course of
a narrative speech. Welcker (p. 433)
plausibly suggests that Minos recalled to
Daedalus the help he had received in his
earlier trouble.</p>
<p>1 f. Holland’s proposal to read ἐπώνυμον,
with κτανών following the quotation
and qualified by ἐν. . .πάγοις, appears to
me highly probable. ἦλθ' thus means
’ came to Crete.' Meineke had suggested
ἦν δ’ ἐπώνυμος (ἦν Blaydes). —

Blaydes also proposed Πέρδιξ τις
for πέρδικος. For the absence of caesura
see Jebb on Ai. 855, but without the
context we cannot judge of the degree of
emphasis intended. — ὄρνιθος . . . πέρδικος :

that the last sentence runs : ὃ δὲ λουσά
μενος (λουόμενος conj. Nauck) ὑπὸ
Κωκάλου θυγατέρων ανῃρέθη ζέουσαν πίσσαν
ἐπιχεαμένων αὐτῷ. Even before the
discovery of the epitome it had been inferred
by Robert (de Apollod. bibl. p. 49)
that Zenobius copied his account from
Apollod orus, and Wagner (Rh. Mtis.
XLI 142) holds that in the last sentence
the original text of Apollodorus must
have been : δὲ ουσάμενος ὑπὸ τῶν K.

αὐτῷ· ὡς δὲ ἔνιοί φασιν, ζεστῷ

Note and on fr. 325. — ὃς
διείρειεν λίνον was supplied by Nauck
on the strength of the account given by
Zenobius, and it would be difficult to
find a better supplement. It is clear that
some such words must have occurred in
the immediate context. For the assimilation
of the optative διείρειεν to the
mood of Svpaifieda see Goodwin §§ 531
558. The device adopted by Daedalus
recalls the thread, also called λίνον in
Apollod. epit. 1. 9 etc., which he gave
to Theseus to guide him on his return
from the labyrinth.</p>

<p>[πισσοκώνητον</p>
<p>325 I admit this fragment for the
sake of convenience, in view of the currency
which it has obtained from its
inchision in Nauck's edition ; but the
case which he makes out in urging its
ascription to Sophocles is extremely weak.
Hesych. 11 p. 564 κωνῆσαι κωνεῖσαι cod.)
πισσοκοπῆσαι (Salmasius conj. πισσοκωνῆσαι,
Nauck πίσσῃ καταχρῖσαι) καὶ
κύκλῳ περιενεγκεῖν. Καὶ πισσοκώνητον
μόρον λέγουσιν, ὅταν πίσσῃ καταχρισθέντες
τινὲς ὑπὸ πυρὸς ἀποθάνωσιν.
Αἰσχύλος Κρήσσαις καὶ Κρατῖνος (so
Alberti for αἰσχύλος καὶ κρατῖνος κρήσαις
cod.). But we know that the phrase
used by Aeschylus in the Κρῆσσαι was
πισσοκωνήτῳ πυρί (fr. 118, from Phot.
lex. p. 430, 24) ; and that Cratinus (fr.
364, 1 116 K.) wrote πισσοκωνίας ἄρην
[or ἀρήν, as Nauck and Headlam (C. R.
X 438), or Ἄρης, as Bergk conjectured].
Nauck argues that π. μ. in Hesych. must
be held to refer to Sophocles, on the
ground that it is an apt description of
the fate of Minos according to the account
given by Zenob. 4. 92 (quoted on fr. 324).
Wagner, Epit. Vat. p. 132, uses this
fragment — as if its authority were established
— in support of his conclusion that
the passage in the epitome was derived
by Apollodorus from the Argument to
Sophocles’ play : see Introductory Note.</p>
<p>But this is to argue in a vicious circle:
and, even though it may be probable that
Sophocles adopted the version which
made boiling pitch the instrument of
’s death, we are still very far
from being able to prove that he used
the phrase πισσοκώνητον μόρον in this
connexion or at all. It is worth remarking
that Minos was a familiar figure
on the Attic stage, and that he was held
up to scorn as a typical oppressor : see
Plut. Thes. 16 καὶ γὰρ ὁ Μίνως ἀεὶ διετέλει
κακῶς ἀκούων καὶ λοιδορούμενος ἐν τοῖς
Ἀττικοῖς θεάτροις, to which Nauck adds
Liban. III 64 οὐχ ὀρᾶτε τὸν Μίνω
πάσχοντα ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς; Now, although
these references may be partly satisfied
by the plays dealing with the adventures
of Theseus or the treachery of Scylla
(Ov. ’st. 2. 393), it is improbable that
Sophocles was the only poet who found
occasion to utilize the well-known story
concerning the ultimate fate of the odious
tyrant.</p>
<p>But, altogether apart from these considerations,
it is doubtful whether the
words πισσοΚώνητον μόρον are suitable to
the circumstances of Minos's death. Our
only evidence affirms that after his bath,
or while he was bathing, the daughters
of Cocalus poured boiling pitch over him.
πισσοκώνητος μόρος, however, like πισσήρης
(Nauck for πισσήρων) μόρος in the
oracle quoted by Heraclides Ponticus ap.
Athen. 524 B, is credibly explained as
referring to a mode of execution in
which the victim is tarred all over and
then set on fire. This kind of punishment,
which is not seldom mentioned, is
the same as the tunica molesta of Juv. 8.

that some masculine noun served to

<p>ὀκωχεύουσιν is a certain correction for
κωχεύουσιν, a form which cannot be supported.
For ὀκωχεύω there is he positive
statement of Hesych. ill p. 194, who
glosses it by ἔχειν, συνέχειν ; and analogy
is strongly in its favour. It is formed
from ὀκωχή, which is more common in
the compound ἀνοκωχή. The latter and
its derivative verb ἀνοκωχεύειν, which is
found in El. 732 (ἀνακωχεύει Mss),
constantly corrupted to ἀνακωχή and
ἀνακωχεύειν (Cobet, N. L. p. 169). All
these forms go back ultimately to the
Ionic perfect of ἔχω, i.e. ὄκωχα: for
Cobet has shown conclusively that συνοκωχότε
should be read for συνοχωκότε in
Hom. B 218 (Misc. Crit. p. 304). — μ' ...

<p>The story which appears to have been the central incident
of the play was related by Hesiod 1 (see EGF p. 89). Orion,
whose mother was Euryale the daughter of Minos, had received
from his father Poseidon the power of walking on the waves.
He came to Chios where Oenopion, the son of Dionysus, put
his eyes out in revenge for a drunken insult offered to his daugh-
ter Merope. The blinded outcast wandered to Lemnos, where
Hephaestus in pity gave him Cedalion, one of his servants, for a
guide. Taking Cedalion on his shoulders to direct his course,
he proceeded towards the rising sun, and so soon as he met the
sun-god recovered his sight. Such is the story told by Eratosth.
catast. 32, schol. Nic. Ther. 15, Hygin. poet. astr. 2. 34, schol.
Arat. 322, together with further details about the fate of Orion,
which do not concern the present play. Apollod. i. 25 varies
the account by stating that Orion came to the workshop of
Hephaestus and seized one of his slaves to act as guide. Servius
<note type="footnote">1 Kinkel and Rzach (fr. 17) include the extract in question among the fragments
of the poem Astronomia: but see Wilamowitz GGN 1895, p. 232. The last-named
scholar holds that Cedalion was originally a dwarf (δάκτυλος: see on fr.366).</note>

<pb n="9"/>
on Verg. Aen. 10. 763 adds important details: (i) that Dionysus
and the satyrs assisted Oenopion to blind Orion; (2) that Orion
consulted the oracle and was told that he would recover his
eyesight, if he walked with his eyes continually turned towards
the est 1. It will be observed that Vergil makes Orion so huge
that he can walk through the sea, and yet keep head and
shoulders above the waves (cum pedes incedit medii per viaxuma
Nerei Ι stagna viam scindens, umero supereminet undas). Lucian
(de domo 28) describes a picture in which the blind Orion was
carrying Cedalion on his shoulders : ὃ δ' αὐτῷ σημαίνει τὴν πρὸς
τὸ φῶς ὁδὸν ἐποχούμενος, καὶ ὁ Ἥλιος φανεὶς ἰᾶται τὴν πήρωσιν,
καὶ ὁ Ἥφαιστος Λημνόθεν ἐπισκοπεῖ τὸ ἔργον.</p>
<p>From these facts it might be inferred that the scene of] the
play was the workshop of Hephaestus at Lemnos, and that
the oracle mentioned by Servius was an element in the plot.
But it is not easy to introduce the story of Oenopion's
or to discover the nature of the dramatic conflict. Hephaestus is
represented as taking the side of Orion, except possibly in Pherecydes,
if he is the authority whom Apollodorus followed. On the
other hand, Dionysus and the satyrs are said to have assisted
Oenopion in a proceeding which recalls the Cyclops of Euripides.
We can hardly attribute both these features to Sophocles ; for
we should then be forced to recognize a conflict between Hephaestus
and Dionysus which is entirely inconsistent with the
cult-connexion of these deities: see Introductory Note to the
Daedalus (l p. 110), and cf Stesich. fr. 72. In the Pandora we
shall find satyrs working in the forge of Hephaestus ; but there
is no adequate reason for supposing such a situation here. The
phallic character of Cedalion is implied in his name, which Wilamowitz 2
no doubt rightly refers to Hesych. II p. 473 κήδαλον·
αἰδοῖον.</p>
<p>It should be added that according to schol. Hom. Ξ 296 (cf.
Eustath. Il. p. 987, 11) Cedalion was a Naxian blacksmith, to
whom Hera apprenticed Hephaestus to learn his art. But it is
improbable that this statement gives the clue to ’ plot,
as Ahrens suggested, or that Hephaestus was handed over by
Cedalion to his servants the satyrs, in order to receive his
instruction from them 3.</p>

Ar. Nub. 450, where the scholia give
two explanations: (1) τουτέστι χαλεπὸς
Καὶ φρικτός, καθὸ καὶ τοὺς ἡνιόχους κεντροτύπους
καλοῦμεν, τοὺς τοῖς κέντροις τοὺς
ἵππους τύπτοντας. This agrees with
’s gl. πλήττων. (2) Κέντρων λέγεται
Καὶ ὁ κλέπτης διὰ τὸ βασανιζομένοις
τοῖς κλέπταις καὶ κέντρα προσφέρεσθαι.
It is obvious that the second explanation
satisfies the requirements of the present
passage, but not that the editors of
Aristophanes are right in entirely neg-
lecting the first. In fact there an active
meaning seems essential to the significance
of the context.</p>
<p>ἀλλοτριοφάγοι was perhaps suggested
to Sophocles by a reminiscence of the
suitors of Penelope: Hom. a 160 ἐπεὶ

The word does not seem to recur except
in a late Byzantine gloss in Suidas s.v.

<p>The insertion of ’ν before Xcvkw
long since recommended by Bergk, but
is not noticed by any editor except
Hartung. Ellendt thinks that the ad-
dition of the preposition is unnecessary
in poetry. But surely the form of the
proverb, even if we leave grammatical
considerations out of account, is strongly
in favour of the insertion. It is better,
however, to place the preposition before
λίθῳ both for metrical reasons and because
it would somewhat more readily fall out
from that position: so Postgate, as suggested
to Tucker, who had independently
proposed Bergk ’s correction (C. R.
xviii 245). It is strange that the dative
λευκῇ στάθμῃ. which is found in one
MS of Suidas and possibly elsewhere,
should not have approved itself to any
of the critics until it was conjecturally
restored by Tucker (l.c.) : the words of
the person addressed and not the speaker
are pronounced useless as a τεκμήριον.
Bergk supposed that the speaker was the
blind Orion, who replied thus to the
verbal directions of Cedalion. — οὐ. . .οὐ:

ἄν τι γένηται τὰ πάντ’ ὄνου σκιά.'
ὄνου σκιά is explained as a proverbial
phrase for what is utterly worthless. It
occurs more often in the form περὶ ὄνου
σκιᾶς (μάχεσθαι or the like) : so in
Fesp. 191, fr. 192 1 437 K. περὶ τοῦ γὰρ
ὑμῖν ὁ πόλεμος Ι νῦν ἐστι; περὶ ὄνου σκιᾶς.
In Plat. Phaedr. 260 A, unless those
critics are right who would bracket σκιᾶς,
ὄνου σκιᾶς appears to be merely a contemptuous
paraphrase for ὄνου — ‘a miserable
donkey.’ Archippus, a poet of
Old Comedy, wrote a play entitled ὄνου
σΚιά or ὄνος (1 686 K.). The explanation
given by the authorities (scholl. Ar. Plat.,
Paroemiogr., Phot., Suid.) is that a young
man travelling to Megara hired an ass to
carry his baggage, and when he desired
to rest during the midday heat of the sun
proposed to recline under the shadow of
the beast of burden. But the donkey-
man objected, arguing that the donkey
had only been hired for a specific purpose,
and that in all other respects he remained
the property of his owner. The hirer
replied that the animal was completely

<pb n="12"/>
under his control for the day, and after
nearly coming to blows the disputants
agreed to submit their difference to the
decision of a law-court. We are also
informed (schol. Plat, mentions Aristides
[περὶ παροιμιῶν] as his source) that Demosthenes,
finding the jury in an important
case disinclined to listen to his
arguments, arrested their attention by
telling them this story, and when he
had sufficiently excited their curiosity,
so that they desired to hear the sequel,
he drove home his point that those
who are so eager about the conclusion
of a trifle ought to be all the more
ready to give their careful attention to
the defence on a capital charge. The
evidence appears conclusive that ὄνουσκιά
was proverbial in the fifth century,
and van ’s theory that its
currency as a proverb did not arise until
after the incident of ’ speech
must be rejected. For, as Didymus ap.
Harpocr. p. 151, ir pertinently remarked,
the proverb is itself parodied by Demosthenes
in the de Pace (5. 25) πρὸς πάντας
περὶ τῆς ἐν Δελφοῖς σκιᾶς νυνὶ πολεμῆσαι.
The story about Demosthenes does not
require to be taken seriously ; but whether
the explanation of the proverb is as old
as the use of the proverb itself, and, if
not, what is the real origin of the

the divided anapaest see on fr. 388) :
Dobree's ὅταν, with a comma after ταῦτα,

Tucker thinks that the sense required is
’all his arguing to the contrary will be

<p>Dindorf was the first to recognize that
τερθρία πνοή was the quotation from
Sophocles, and that μέντοι belongs to the
grammarian distinguishing τερθρία
Tepdpeia. — On a ship certain ropes were
called τέρθριοι: see Erotian gloss. Hippocr.

κάλοι, οὓς ἐκφόρους καλοῦσιν οἱ
ναῦται, οὓς ὅταν ἐνδιδῷ τὸ πνεῦμα, πρώτους
ἐΚ πρῴρας χαλῶσι. This is not very
explicit, but we may infer that they were
ropes employed for reefing the sails, and
that they were fastened to the ἠλακάτη
(Ap. Rhod. 1. 565). The meaning
comes out clearly in Ar. Eq. 440, where
τοὺς τερθρίους παρίει, Ι τὸ πνεῦμ᾿
yiyverai is contrasted with id. 436 τοῦ
ποδὸς παρίει· Ι ὡς οὗτος ἤδη καικίας ἢ συκοφαντίας
πνεῖ. One would infer from this
that τερθρία πνοή was not so much a following
wind (ὁπισθία) as a stiff
requiring the use of the end-ropes or
reefing-points. It should be added that
τέρθρον ‘ end, point, top,' from which
τέρθρ-ιο-ς comes, is etymologically distinct
from τερθρεία ’empty chatter,’
contains a reduplicated root: see Brugmann,
Comp. Gr. 11 p. 95, 111 p. 3 E. tr.
Mekler thinks that τερθρία πνοή may
signify πορδή in a satyr-play.</p>

(so all the MSS, but the word is of course
corrupt. Welcker proposed ἀλοόφρονα,
Lobeck ἀσίφρονα or βλαψίφρονα, and
Wagner κακόφρονα ; but none of these
words is likely to have been used as an
explanation by Erotian. Burges suggested
οὐ σώφρονα, which gives the
wrong sense. I should restore σωφρον
ν&#x003C;ίζοντ&#x003E;α, ’the punisher,’
to satisfy the requirements of the passage),

‘τὸν δὲ ἀνταῖον περιδινέοντα οὐχ ὁρᾶτε;'
καί· ‘ δεῖμα προσπαίοντα ἀνταίας θεοῦ.’
This very difficult and puzzling passage
of Erotian has not been satisfactorily
emended. So far as Sophocles is con-
cerned, the most important question is
whether we are to recognize (i) two
separate fragments, according to the opinion
of Burges, who gave them as ‘τὸν δ’
ἀνταῖον περιδινεύνοτ᾿ and ‘καὶ δεῖμα
ἀπ' ἀνταίας θεοῦ,’ of
who conjectured ‘τὸν δ’ ἀνταῖον περιδηνεύοντά
(π. = ‘ callidum esse') θ' ὁρᾶτε'
‘δεῖμα προσπνέοντα τἀνταίας θεοῦ' assigning
the second line to the Polyidus (fr.
400), and of Klein, the editor of Erotian,
or (2) a single quotation, with καί
linking two co-ordinate clauses. On the
latter assumption Lobeck (Path. Prol.
p. 162) proposed τὴν ἄγχιμον δὲ πῦρ δονοῦσαν
οὐΧ ὁρᾷς Ι καὶ δεῖμα προσπνέουσαν
ἀνταίας θεοῦ; and Campbell, with still
greater violence, τὸν ἄντιον πνέοντα δ᾿
οὐχ ὁρᾷς θεὸν Ι καὶ δεῖμα προσφέροντ᾿
ἀνταίας deov, interpreting τὸν. . .θεόν as the
storm-wind sent by Artemis which delayed
the Greeks at Aulis. Of these
alternatives I prefer the former for two
reasons: (1) the repetition of the adj.
ἀνταῖος after so short an interval in a
continuous passage is difficult to explain,

<pb n="14"/>
unless the clauses are so balanced in
order to contrast the goddess, whoever
she may be, with the instrument which
she employs. This is the solution of
Welcker, who thinks ’Antaeus’ was a
demon in the service of Hecate (ἀνταίας
θεοῦ); but there is no evidence of the
existence of such a supernatural figure,
although ’s view is adopted by
Wernicke in Pauly-Wissowa i 2343.
That ἀνταῖον is corrupt (see above) is in
the highest degree improbable. (2) A
still more serious obstacle to be overcome
by those who support the continuity
of the quotation is that of the metre.
This is either ignored, as by Welcker,
or thrust aside by the crude and improbable
remedies already mentioned.
Nauck, who prints the reading of the
MSS practically unaltered, evidently regarded
the passage as desperate. For
the reasons given I have divided it into
two fragments, of which the former may
be rendered : ‘ ye do not perceive the
enemy (avenger) hovering near.’ But
is idle to guess at the nature of the
reference, when we cannot even tell what
-was the plot of the play from which the
words are quoted. The story of Clytaemnestra
would permit an allusion to
Aegisthus, or at a later time to Orestes.
— τὸν δ᾿ ἀνταῖον: this word acquired
meaning ’hostile, harmful’ in
way as ἐνάντιος: see on fr. 747, and cf.
frs. 72, 400. Etym. M. p. iii, 49 Καὶ
ἀνταῖος, ὁ βλάβης αἴτιος. But ἀνταῖος is
particularly applied to the hostility of the
gods (so in Aesch. Pers. 606 f. ἐμοὶ γὰρ
ἤδη πάντα μὲν φόβου πλέα Ι ἐν ὄμμασιν
τἀνταῖα φαίνεται θεῶν, which is correctly
explained by the schol.), and as an
epithet of Hecate has chthonian associations.
Etym. Μ. p. 111, 50 ἀνταία καὶ
ἡ ‘Εκάτη ἐπιθετικῶς. Hesych. 1 p. 209
ἀνταία. . .σημαίνει δὲ καὶ δαίμονα. καὶ τὴν
Ἑκάτην δὲ ἀνταίαν λέγουσιν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐπιπέμπειν
avrd. There avrd is corrupt,
for ’s view that it refers to ὁαιμόνια
(sc. ἀνταῖα), which he substitutes
for δαίμονα is unsatisfactory. Why
should we not read ἄντα, which is explained
by Hesych. shortly before and
clearly accounts for the appellative ? In
any case ἐπιπέμπειν shows that Hecate
was so called as sending apparitions :
see on Eur. Hel. 570, The epithet was
also attached to Rhea, and there are
two traditional explanations : schol.
Apoll. Rhod. 1. 1141 ἡ Ῥέα οὕτω λέγεται,
διότι ἐναντία τοῖς Τελχῖσιν ἐγένετο, ὡς δέ
τινες, ἀνταίη ἡ εὐλιτάνευτος καὶ εὐάντητος.
The second interpretation coincides with
the gloss ἱκέσιος given by Hesych. and
Etym. M. (cf. Aesch.fr. 223), but it is not
unlikely, as Gruppe (Gr. Myth. p. 15392)
has already suggested, that evdvrrjros and
ἱκέσιος are really instances of euphemism :
see Etym. Μ. p. 388, 36 εὐάντητος· ἡ
Ῥέα· ἀνταίαν γὰρ αὐτὴν ἐκάλουν διὸ τὸ
δυσάντητον εἶναι καὶ τοῖς ἀπαντῶσιν ἐν τοῖς
ὄρεσι δυσχεραίνειν. Dieterich (Orphica,
p. 14) points out that εὐάντητος frequently
occurs in prayers to δαίμονες. In the case
of Antaeus, ’the adverary’ or
the generic term has been individualized.
— περιδινεύοντα, as translated above in
accordance with the Homeric use of
διεύω, yields an appropriate sense ; but
every conclusion is necessarily uncertain.
—οὐ καθορᾶτε is suggested to suit the
anapaestic metre.</p>

up δεῖμα, which is exactly the right word
if ἀνταίας deov means Hecate, as has been
shown to be probable: cf. El. 410, with
’s note. For προσπαίω, which is not
well authenticated, see the comm. on
Aesch. Prom. 910. Nauck formerly conjectured
προστρόπαιον, and other views
have already been mentioned in the n.
on fr. 334. It is possible, as Bergk
thought, that these words really belong
to the Polyidus (fr. 400) ; but, so far as
the evidence of Erotian goes, they appear
to be attributed to the Clytaemnestra, and
we have nothing to displace it.</p>

<pb n="15"/>
<p>ΚOΛΧΙmΣ</p>
<p>Sophocles was the only one of the three great tragedians to
put upon the stage the adventures of Jason in Colchis which
culminated in his capture of the Golden Fleece, after he had
secured the powerful assistance of Medea. It is unnecessary
to recapitulate the familiar story, either as narrated with all its
details by Apollonius Rhodius in the third and the early part
of the fourth book of the Argonautica, or even as summarized by
Apollod. 1. 127 — 132. We must rather endeavour to ascertain
which parts of the current legend may reasonably be attributed
to Sophocles.</p>
<p>The title reveals the scene of the action, and the fact that
the chorus was composed of women — probably attendants of
Medea — indicates the importance of her share in the plot. It
is highly probable that the hostility of Aeetes towards Jason
and his companions was attributed not merely to the savage
and inhospitable disposition of the king, but partly at least
to an oracle, which, according to Herodorus (FHG 11 39), our
earliest authority, declared that he would perish by the hands
of his own kindred. In Apoll. Rhod. 3. 597 ff., where the fears of
Aeetes are directed towards the sons of Phrixus and his daughter
Chalciope, the oracle is thus quoted :
<lg>
<l>ὥς ποτε βάξιν</l>
<l>λευγαλέην οὗ πατρὸς ἐπέκλυεν Ἠελίοιο,</l>
<l>χρειώ μιν πυκινόν τε δόλον βουλάς τεγενέθλης</l> 
<l>σφωιτέρης ἄτην τε πολύτροπον ἐξαλέασθαι.</l></lg>
On the other hand in Hygom. fab. 22 and Diod. 4. 47 the oracle
is made to warn Aeetes that the security of his kingdom depended
on his continued possession of the Golden Fleece. The
double task of ploughing with the fire-breathing bulls and sowing
the ’s teeth was imposed by Aeetes (frs. 336, 341), as in
the ordinary version. The meeting between Jason and Medea,
in which he asked for her help in the impending trial, took place
before the spectators, and the instructions necessary to insure
his success were given to Jason in the course of the dialogue
which ensued : see schol. Ap. Rh. 3. 1040 Σοφοκλῆς δὲ ἐν ταῖς
Κολχίσιν εἰσάγει τὴν Μήδειαν ὑποτιθεμένην τῷ Ἰάσονι περὶ τοὐ
ἄθλου δι᾿ ἀμοιβαίων. There is nothing to show how the
was brought about, whether through the intervention of Chalciope
and her sons as in Apollonius, or by some other means.
But it is probable that ’s passion for Jason was kindled,
if not by the direct instigation of Aphrodite, at least by some
divine agency: cf Find. Pyth. 4. 213. Fr. 345 probably comes

<pb n="16"/>
from a passage descriptive of the power of Love ; but it is
curious that Ganymede was represented by Apollonius (3. 115)
as playing with Eros, when the latter was summoned by his
mother in order that he might attract Medea to Jason. On the
same occasion Jason seems to have taken an oath, promising to
Medea that, if he succeeded in the trial, he would marry her and
take her back with him to Greece (fr. 339); but it is worthy
of notice that in Apollonius (4. 88) the oath is introduced just
before the final adventure in which the dragon guarding the
fleece was slain. It is pointed out in the notes to fr. 340 that
the allusion to Prometheus was probably made in the course of
a description of the Promethean ointment, which was given to
Jason to make him invulnerable. Welcker finds a reference
to the παρέκβασις on Prometheus in an obscure scholium on
Pind. Pyth. 5.35 καὶ Σοφοκλῆς δὲ ἐν τῷ Προμηθεῖ τοῦ Προμηθέως,
θελων λέγειν τῆς φρονήσεως ἀντέχεσθαι καὶ μὴ τῆς μεταμελείας,
thinking that Medea used the story of Prometheus as a moral
to warn Jason to be forearmed against all contingencies. This
is a far-fetched conjecture, and it is easier to suppose that the
name of Sophocles was introduced in error, and that the writer
of the note simply intended to quote Aesch. Prom. 86 1. The
scholia to Apollonius make it plain that at several points in this
part of his narrative the Alexandrian poet could be illustrated
from the play of Sophocles ; and the dramatic character of the
whole description of Medea's relations with Jason suggests
Apollonius was influenced by the Colchides to an extent which
it is now impossible to trace.</p>
<p>The success of Jason in his trials was announced to Aeetes
by a messenger (fr. 341), but the subsequent development of the
action is unknown. It is obvious that there must have been a
further interview with Medea in preparation for the final seizure
of the fleece, unless indeed Sophocles adopted a version diverging
widely from Apollonius, such as that of the Naupactia 2. That
such was the case is rendered not unlikely by the fact that the two
poets certainly did not agree in their treatment of the relations
between Medea and her brother or half-brother Apsyrtus. For
the various accounts of their parentage see on fr. 546, where it is
shown that Sophocles, both in the Κολχίδες and in the Σκύθαι,
made Apsyrtus much younger than Medea. Fr. 343 (n.) proves
that in the present play Apsyrtus, a mere child, was killed in

the palace of Aeetes. The motive for the crime is not explained,
but the scholiast on Apollonius, who gives a fuller account of
the story as told by Pherecydes (FHG 1 89), states that Medea
took the child from his bed at ’s bidding, and brought him
to the Argo ; and that, when the pursuit began, he was killed
and his body cut in pieces and thrown into the river, — clearly
with the object of delaying the pursuit. The natural inference
is that a similar motive prompted the murder in the house ; for,
if the reason had been different, it would probably have been
stated by our authorities 1.</p>

doubtful, with the exception of the accent

Sophocles. The blurred letters suggest

but the newer collation of Drachmann

ὥσπερ rather than ὡς followed μυκτήρ.
The difficulty of restoration is increased
by the obscurity of the introductory
words, and I have not been able to find
anything in the authorities to justify ἀδερμάτους,
if by that word in conjunction
with χαλκοῦς it is meant that the bulls
had a covering of brass in place of a
hide. Elsewhere they are constantly

<p>Practically all our knowledge of the

discussion which is the source of the
present fragment. He also quotes frs.
338, 538 and 539, as well as fragments
from Aeschylus, Ibycus, Callimachus, and
Euphorion. Outside Galen's notice πέμφιξ
occurs only once in Nicander and
twice in Lycophron. The central notion
is air driven or expelled, α puff of wind;
hence Galen finds the meatiing πνοή in
the present passage, in fr. 538, and in
Aesch. fr. 195. It is thus applied to air
enclosed in water, α bubble : Nic. Ther.

Galen notes its employment to express
drops of rain (ἐπὶ τῶν κατὰ τοὺς
σταγόνων), quoting Callim. fr. 483 (11
p. 640 Schneider), and Euphorion (v.
infr.), — both doubtful passages; and similarly,
drops of any liquid (ἐπὶ
quoting Aesch. fr. 183 μηδ’ αἵματος πέμφιγα

difficult passage corrected by Headlam in

πέμφιγας πιόμενοι, which is stated to
occur in a simile referring to storm-tossed
voyagers (κατά τινα παραβολὴν ἐπὶ

is undoubtedly meant. The extract however
follows fr. 539, and is included by
Galen under the signification cloud (ἐπὶ
νέφους δοκεῖ τετάχθαι). Bergk maintains
that there has been a displacement
in the text, that the quotation from Ibycus
ought actually to follow Aesch. fr. 183
and that ἐπὶ δὲ τοῦ νέφους κτἑ. was the
concluding portion of Galen's

mist of rain-clouds, νέφη is an intelligible
paraphrase of πυκινὰς πέμφιγας (cf.
Chrysippus 11 701 Arn. τὴν ὁμίχλην
νέφος διακεχύμενον. . .ὄμβρον δὲ λάβρου
ὕδατος καὶ πολλοῦ ἐΚ νεφῶν φοράν), and
the necessity for transposing the text
disappears. Thus it would seem that
πέμφιξ might be applied to a siorm of
wind and rain, though the idea of a
whirlwind prevails in Aesch. fr. 195
Βορεάδας ἥξεις πρὸς πνοάς, ἵν᾿
βρόμον καταιγίζοντα, μή σ’ ἀναρπάσῃ
δυσχειμέρῳ πέμφιγι συστρέψας ἄνω. In
Soph. fr. 538, which Galen, as we have
seen, includes under the gloss πνοή,
storm is perhaps the best translation,
as comprehending the ideas of flashing
light, blasting wind, and possibly heavy
rain (see n. in loc.). At this point we
must notice the remarkable transition of
meaning by which πέμφιξ comes to signify
a ray of light (ἐπὶ τῶν ἀκτίνων: cf.
lex. p. 409, 10 πέμφιξ· πνοή. Αἰσχύλος
Ξαντρίαις ἐπὶ τῶν ἀκτίνων) : so fr. 338
Aesch. fr. 170 οὔτε πέμφιξ ἡλίου προσδέρκεται,
Ι οὔτ' ἀστερωπὸν ὄμμα Λητῴας
κόρης. It may be surmised that in
strictness a moving, flashing light rather
than a steady flame is implied. Thus in
some respects πέμφιξ is seen to resemble
πρηστήρ, thefery waterspout, as described
by Lucr. ὁ. 424 ff. Moreover the concatenation
of the ideas of wind, cloud,
and light is illustrated by the pronouncements
of contemporary meteorology, particularly
thai of Anaximander (fr. 20
Diels), with whom Anaximenes (A 17
Diels) agreed: Aet. plac. 3. 3 περὶβροντῶν
ἀστραπῶν κεραυνῶν πρηστήρων τε
καὶ τυφώνων. Ἀναξίμανδρος ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος
ταυτὶ πάντα συμβαίνειν· ὅταν γὰρ
περιληφθὲν νέφειπαχεῖ βιασάμενον ἐκπέσῃ
τῇ λεπτομερείᾳ καὶ κουφότητι, τότε ἡ μὲν
ῥῆξις τὸν ψόφον, ἡ δὲ διαστολὴ παρὰ τὴν
μελανίαν τοῦ νέφους τὸν διαυγασμὸν
ἀποτελεῖ. It should be added that Lycophron
in v. 686 ἀκούσει κεῖθι πεμφίδων
ὄπα and in v. 1106 employs πέμφιξ in
the sense of α ghost. This development
was no doubt influenced by popular
belief and philosophical speculation on
the nature of the ψυχὴ. It is tempting
to find the same meaning in the corrupt
line of Euphorion (Meineke, anal. Alex.
p. 118) : ἠπεδαναὶ (so Bentley for εἶπε δ’
ἄνθη) πέμφιγες ἐπιτρύζουσι θανόντα θανόντων?);
but Galen's authority is not
be lightly disregarded.`</p>
<p>The present fragment is unfortunately

<pb n="19"/>
corrupt. Bentley conjectured πέμφιξ
Ἰονίου πέλας πόρου or μέμφιξ ἐξ ἕω σελασφόρου.
σελασφόρου seems certain, but
Μ. Schmidt's ἡλίου is clearly preferable
to ἐξ ἕω. ἡλίου σελασφόρου is accordingly
adopted by Nauck, and with this reading
we should translate ’ a wind came rushing
from the blazing ’: cf. Aesch. Ag.
1179 f Anyhow πέμφιξ could not mean
’ray’ in the face of ’s statement.
I cannot however help suspecting, on the
assumption that ἀπῇξε πέμφιξ. . .σελασφόρου
is sound, that the words refer to
the fiery breath of the bulls which Jason
was required to yoke: ApoU. Rhod. 3.
410 στόματι φλόγα φυσιόωντες, 1048
ἄσχετος ἀίσσουσα φλὸξ ὀλοῶν ταύρων,
1292 πυρὸς σέλας ἀμπνείοντες. Such
also was ’s view when he proposed
ὡς ἰπνοῦ σελασφόρου; and so
Wecklein, as will be mentioned on fr.
339. ἐξ ἰπνοῦ, R. Ellis. In justification
of ἰπνοῦ Hermann well quoted Ar. Pac.
839 ff.: but would Sophocles have used
the simile in a tragedy.? Postgate's ἵξινοὐ
σελασφόρον (J. Ρ. X 91), i.e. ’the
πέμφιξ sprang away on its dark path,’
does not yield a satisfactory meaning.
The letters ἴου suggest πνου, but
πυρπνόου will not fit : γένυος ἐΚ σελασφόρου
is perhaps possible.</p>

<p>Welcker suggested that these words
were spoken by Medea to Jason, asking
him to swear to make her his wife and
take her back to Greece, if she lent him
her assistance. He quoted, among other
passages, Ov. Met. 7 94 servabere munere
nostro: Ι seruatus promissa dato, and Zenob.
4. 92 (=Apollod. 1. 129) Μήδεια. . .ἐπαγγέλλεται

κτἑ. This seems better than to suppose
that Jason was asking Aeetes for an
assurance that, if he performed the task
imposed, he should receive the fleece.
Wecklein (B. ph. W. 1898. 739) refers
this and frs. 337, 338 to the dialogue
mentioned by schol. Ap. Rhod. 3. 1040
in the order 339. 337, 338.</p>
<p>ὑπόμνυμι (see cr. n.) does not occur,
except in the middle voice with the
technical sense of swearing an oath for
the purpose of staying legal proceedings.
In view of the frequency with which
compounds with ἐπί and ὑπό are confused
(for examples see Cobet, Ν. L. p. 379
Coll. Crit. pp. 92, 505; Madvig, Adu.
Crit. 1 p. 516), it is much more probable
that we should read ἐπομνύς than that the

Until the MS known as A had been
collated by Bekker, whose edition ap-
peared in 1846, the texts of Pollux gave
ζωστῆρσιν in place of Κολχίσιν ; and the
strangeness of the title puzzled the earlier
critics. Brunck did not believe in the
possibility of such a play ; but Welcker,
after some hesitation (Nachtr. p. 292),
pronounced in favour of a satyr-play on
’ quest of the Amazonian girdle
(Pind. fr. 172 καὶ μετὰ ζωστῆρας Ἀμαζόνος
ἦλθεν), appealing to the play of Epicharmus
entitled Ἡρακλῆς ὁ ἐπὶ τὸν
ζωστῆρα (p. 104 Kaibel).
But the recovery of the title does not
solve the whole difficulty. ἐπιζώστρα
does not occur elsewhere, and is not the
kind of word one would expect to find
in Sophocles; indeed, as Nauck remarks,
not only are the words corrupt — for
ἐχοντες at any rate is required — but the
whole sentence is unlike tragedy. It
reads more like a mutilated fragment
from an Alexandrian writer of elegiacs
such as Callimachus or Euphorion. περιζώστρα

350 B.C.) fr. 69, 11 162 K.</p>

<p>The heavier first aorists, such as ἀπῃλλάχθην,
ἐθρέφθην, ἐβλάφθην, ἐφάνθην and
so forth, passed out of use in late Greek,
giving way to ἀπηλλάγην, ἐτράφην etc.
Hence the former class is frequently
glossed by the latter, and some textual
corruption has arisen in consequence:
see Valckenaerand Porsonon Eur. Phoen.
979 (986) and Headlam, On editing
Aeschylus, p. 104. But ἐπαλλαγείς does
not occur, and ἐπαλλάττειν, never a common
word, is generally intransitive from
the time of Aristotle onwards.</p>

<p>ΚΠΕΟΥΣΑ</p>
<p>There are only two certain references to the title Ion (frs. 319
320) which has been with high probability identified with the
Creusa.</p>
<p>Creusa was also the name of (i) ’s daughter, the wife
of Aeneas, and (2) ’s rival, who is commonly called Glauce
(Hygin. fab. 25). But, if the latter had been the Creusa of
Sophocles, we should surely have heard more about the play in
which she appeared. Although the fragments themselves throw
no light on the nature of the plot, the general opinion is probably
correct that the heroine was the daughter of Erechtheus and wife
of Xuthus, and that the story, like that of the Ion of Euripides,
was concerned with the fortunes of her son Ion, who was born

<pb n="24"/>
from her union with Apollo in a cave on the Acropolis (Pausan.
I. 28. 4). Until adopted into literature by the tragedians, it is
probable that the history of Ion's parentage was only preserved
orally in connexion with the local worship of Apollo at Athens.
At any rate, it finds no place in the mythological hand-books,
and as we have no other channel of information than the play
of Euripides, it is impossible to say which of the details are the
invention of that poet, and which, as belonging to the common
stock, may be assumed to have been retained by Sophocles.</p>
<p>Welcker infers from fr. 353 that the chorus consisted of
female attendants on Creusa. On the strength of Eur. Ion 323
βωμοί μ’ ἔφερβον οὑπιών τ᾿ ἀεὶ ξένος he assigns frs. 354 and
to Ion, and supposes him to be speaking of his own poverty
which made him dependent on the charity of visitors to the
temple. Fr. 357 is referred to a contemplated revelation of
Xuthus similar to his confession in Eur. Ion 550 fif. 550 but it
might equally well be regarded as a cry of Creusa, when forced
to disclose her story.</p>

The active is also found, looking to the
object rather than to the agent: Hipp.
521, El. 648, I. Α. 401.</p>
<p>2 τὴν βλάβην. Nauck says ’malim
πημονήν,᾿ finding an awkwardness, as
suppose, in the article. But it is possible
that the context would have made every-
thing clear, as would be the case if e.g.
τῶν δὲ συμφορῶν preceded ταῦτ᾿,
θέσθαι with an object. — φέρων is
used idiomatically of impetuous or impulsive
action, sponte, ultra. H. quotes
Aeschin. 3. 82 εἰς τοῦτο φέρων περιέστησε

He adds that the idiom is illustrated in
the Thesaurus, s.v. φέρω p. 721 D, and
refers to Hemsterhuis on Lucian (dial.
vwrt. 6. 3) I 349. See also Holden on
Plut. Them. 24, who has a good collection
of examples, and add Quint. 7. 381

similar case of ἔχων (Blaydes on Ar. Nub.
131), and might be rendered ’if he goes
and infiicts the hurt on himself.’
proposed θέλων, Stadtmueller τρέφων, and
F. W. Schmidt φρονῶν in its place ; and

Menand. fr. 572, 111 175 K. ὅταν τι πράττῃς
ὅσιον, ἀγαθὴν ἐλπίδα Ι πρόβαλλε

dative of manner like λώβαις ἐκβαλεῖν
in Ai. 1392. Cf. Eur. Hel. 393
κόμπῳ λέγω, Phoen. 1125 ἐσκίρτων φόβῳ.
In some examples the idea of cause may
have been the more prominent: see
Kuehner-Gerth i 435, 439. — πρὸς τὸ
δεινὸν ἔρχεται, goes to meet the coming
danger. Cf. Eur. Hclid. 562 ἐπεὶ σφαγῆς

approach the dread task?’)
on the strength of Eur. Med. 394 τόλμης
δ’ εἶμι πρὸς τὸ καρτερόν, proposed τόλμης
for τόλμῃ; but there, as Verrall pointed
out, the meaning is rather ’to pursue the
course of boldness.' — ὀρθή is not easy to
render exactly. Although the adjective
sometimes comes near to the English
true or good, it is strictly limited to the
external aspect of an action as measured
by its result, and never carries with it an
ethical connotation analogous to that of
our sincere or straightforivard. In O.T.
1220, Track. 374, Ai. 354 the meaning
is simply to ‘ speak the truth'; in Ant.
1195 ὀρθὸν ἁλήθει᾿ ἀεί ‘the truth is
i.e. as being incontrovertible ; but the

Meineke conjectured that these lines
were written by Euripides, and that the
passage quoted from Sophocles by the
anthologist had accidentally fallen out.
It must be admitted that the concluding
lines have the Euripidean tone ; but it is
worth notice that Sophocles is the only
tragedian who is known to have used
ἀπρίξ. Hense thinks that the Creusa
may have been a late play : see 1 p. 62.</p>
<p>2 ff. Nauck urges that instead of

<pb n="27"/>
μακρὸν βίον we should rather expect
πλοῦτον βαθύν, which Blaydes modifies
to πλεῖστον βίον (πολὺν βίον, Herwerden).
The criticism is beside the mark; for the
sequence of thought is: ‘Don’t be surprised
that I cling to gain; for (1) the
passion for gain survives even in the old
(who have lost all other desires), (2)
money is the greatest good. Thus Καί
in v. 2 corresponds to Καί in v. 4,
a more emphatic combination than τε...
τε: not only . . . but also. For avarice as
the special infirmity of old age see Arist.

The reference in Thucydides may be
merely to proverbial wisdom, although
it has been supposed that Simonides was
intended: Plut. sen. resp. ger. 5 p. 786 B
Σιμωνίδης ἔλεγε πρὸς τοὺς ἐγκαλοῦντας

often appears as marking the apodosis of
a sentence, whether the protasis is introduced
by εἰ or some other conjunction,
or consists, as here, of a relative clause.
In such cases it may either emphasize
a single word or spread its force over the
whole of the conclusion. See Neil on
Εq. p. 199 f., who quotes . Ant. 657 and
Eur. Bacch. 443 ἃς δ᾿ αὖ σὺ βάκχας εἶρξας
. . . φροῦδαί γ᾿ ἐκεῖναι. Meineke's τοὐπικερδαίνειν
is thus unnecessary, and the
simple verb suits the context better, as the
passages cited above will show: so fr. 28,
3. — ἀπρίξ. For this word see Jebb on
Ai. 310, 1030. The prefix is from an
original sm- (Skt. sa), as in ἅπαξ, ἁπλοῦς
etc. But the evidence for an aspirate in
ἀπρίξ is inconsiderable: cf. ἄλοχος and
see Brugmann Cοmp. Gr. 1 p. 421 E. tr.
It should be added that the ancient
authorities (Hesych., Etym. Μ., Suid.,
al.), all of whom go back to a single
source, derive the word from a privative
and πρίω (πρίζω), ‘to saw,’ ὃ οὐχ οἶόν τε
πρίσαι διὰ τὴν σύμφυσιν. But the gloss of
Cyrillus ἀπρὶξ ἵππος· ὁ σκληρυνθεὶς καὶ
ἐνδακὼν τὸν χαλινὸν ἵππος, when compared
with fr. 897, points in the true
direction. Cf. Alciphr. 3. 54 ἐγὼ δ᾿
ἀπρὶξ τῶν κερμάτων εἰχόμην, ἀποθανεῖν
νεῖν πρότερον ἢ προέσθαι τι ἐκείνοις τῶν

ἆρ᾿ ἔστι λῆρος πάντα πρὸς τὸ χρυσίον;
Eur. fr. 95 ἀλλ᾿ οὐδὲν ηὑγένεια πρὸς τὰ

τὰ χρήματ᾿ ἀνθρώποισι τιμιώτατα. For
the use of πρός, ‘in comparison with,’
see Jebb on Ant. 1171, Ar. Lys. 860.</p>
<p>5 ff. εἰσὶ δ᾿ οἵτινες refers to the famous
scolion (8 Bergk) beginning ὑγιαίνειν μὲν
ἄριστον ἀνδρὶ θνατῷ. See also on fr. 356.
—ἐμοὶ δ᾿ οὐδεὶς κτἑ. This seemingly
paradoxical statement would be less
startling to a Greek audience than it is
to us, for it would recall to them the
proverbial wisdom of Hesiod Op. 686
χρήματα γὰρ ψυχὴ πέλεται δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι,
which is imitated by Timocles fr.

105, 11 574 K. πενία δὲ τοῖς ἔχουσιν οὐ
σμικρὰ νόσος. The thought that natural
advantages such as health and birth (cf.
Eur. El. 38, Phoen. 442) are not of much
avail, unless accompanied by sufficient
wealth, may be illustrated by Ar. Av.
605 ὡς ἄνθρωπός γε κακῶς πράττων ἀτεχνῶς

that these passages ought to be
used to interpret Pind. Ol. 5. 23 ὑγιέντα
δ᾿ εἴ τις ὄλβον ἄρδει, which is understood
by the commentators of the righteous
use or acquisition of wealth. Aristophanes
coined the word πλουθυγίεια to
denote supreme human bliss.—For the

These verses are the recasting of an
old piece of proverbial philosophy. According
to Aristotle (eth. Eud. 1. 1 init.,
eth. Ν. 1. 8. 14. 1099 a 25) there was
inscribed on the προπύλαιον of the Λητῷον
at Delos (τό Δηλιακὸν ἐπίγραμμα)
couplet κάλλιστον τὸ δικαιότατον· λῷστον
δ’ ὑγιαίνειν· πάντων ἥδιστον δ’ (or ἥδιστον
δὲ πέφυχ') οὗ τις ἐρᾷ τὸ τυχεῖν. The
same is found among the remains of
Theognis (255 f.) with the variant πρᾶγμα
δὲ τερπνότατον τοῦ in the second line.
Amongst the sayings attributed to Thales
in Stobaeus flor. 3. 79 (111 p. 172 Hense)
is ἥδιστον οἶ ἐπιθυμεῖς τυχεῖν (Diels,
L. 2. 136) τὸ τυχεῖν ὧν ἄν τις ἐπιθυμῇ'
εἶπε ‘ πολλῷ μεῖζόν ἐστι τὸ μηδὲ ἐπιθυμεῖν

λῷστον δ’ ἀεὶ ζῆν or λῷστον δὲ ναίειν.
Tucker for the same reason proposed

necessary in any case.</p>
<p>3 λῆψις is objected to by Nauck, who

<p>We cannot tell whether Sophocles followed

attribute of a noun like πάθος (cf. Ai.

whether after the pattern of ἰσόμοιρος,
ἰσόκωλος etc., ἰσοθάνατοι may have been
an epithet of those who, like Saul and
Jonathan, Mn their death were not
’ Pollux condemns the compound
as an extravagance; and Jebb
made a curious slip (on At. 214 f. in
saying that ‘ Sophocles used ἰσοθάνατον

of his n. on Ο. T. 478.</p>
<p>ΚΡΙΣΙΣ ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚΗ</p>
<p>Although the evidence for this title is very scanty, the
existence of the play is free from doubt, and its subject — the
Judgement of Paris on Mt Ida — is clearly indicated by fr. 361 (n.).
The play was satyric, and was a sequel to the Ἔρις; see 1 p. 139.
To the evidence there adduced for the appearance of κρίσις and
κρίνω in this connexion add Eur. Hel. 26 μορφῆς θέλουσαι διαπεράνασθαι
Κρίσιν. ib. 678 ἵνα θεοὶ μορφὰν Ι ἐφαίδρυναν, ἔνθεν
ἔμολεν κρίσις. Tro. 924 ἔκρινε τρισσὸν ζεῦγος ὅδε τρισσῶν θεῶν.
The subject is referred to in Horn. Ω 28 ff. Αλεξάνδρου ἕνεκ

the version of the Cypria, about which we only know that
Hermes conducted the goddesses to Mt Ida by the command
of Zeus, and that Alexander, moved by the promise of Helen's
hand, preferred Aphrodite to her rivals (EGF p. 17). Apollod.
epit. 3. 2 adds that Hera promised universal empire, and Athena
victory in war. See also n. on fr. 361.</p>

Several words were omitted in

<p>The meaning of τῷδ' ὡς ἐμῷ is obscure
(‘in dieses selbstgemachte Kleid' Hartung),

τῷδ' ὡς ἔχω and Naber τῷ βυσσίνῳ. Janowski
(Obseruat. in nomina vestium a

the text by supposing that the words were
spoken by a satyr, who had appropriated
for himself the robe of one of the
goddesses taking part in the submission
to ’s judgement. — φᾶρος is
Homeric and older than φάρος; but the
word is believed to be of foreign origin,
which may account for a variable pronunciation.
The usage of Euripides
fluctuates, but Aeschylus (except perhaps
in Theb. 316) always has α&#x772;, and Sophocles
always α.</p>

It is hardly to be doubled that Athenaeus
had this play in view at 510 C,
where after quoting the well-known
anecdote of Sophocles recorded by Plat.
rep. 329 C, he proceeds : ἐγὼ δέ φημι καὶ
τὴν τοῦ Πάριδος κρίσιν ὑπὸ τῶν παλαιοτέρων

οὖσαν σύγκρισιν· προκριθείσης γοῦν τῆς
Ἀφροδίτης, αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶν ἡ ἡδονή, πάντα
συνεταράχθη.</p>
<p>If we leave out of account Hes. Op.
287 ff., this is the earliest instance re-
corded in literature of the allegorical
presentation of the conflict between
Pleasure and Virtue, which afterwards
became famous through the fable known
as the Choice of Heracles extracted by
Xenophon from the Ὧραι of Prodicus
(Diels, Fragin. d. Vorsokratiker 2, p. 657).
Although the moral is implicit in the
story of the Κρίσις, it is improbable that
it was enforced in the Cypria (Wilamowitz,
Eur. Her. 2, 1 p. 101). It has even
been held by Stephani (Gnippe, Gr.
Myth. p. 6656) that the allegorical
motive prevailed so strongly with Sophocles
that he left out Hera altogether;
but that is altogether unlikely. For the
allegorical treatment by the Stoics of the
opposition between Pleasure and Virtue
see Cleanth. fr. 90 (i 553 Arn.) and
Chrysipp. ap. Gell. Ν. A. 14. 4 (Arnim
III p. 197); and generally for the subsequent
influence of ’ apologue
Cougny, de Prodico Ceio, Paris 1857
p. 79 ff., and Dieterich, Nekyia, p. 191.</p>
<p>In describing the adornment of Aphrodite,
Sophocles may have been influenced
by Hom. σ 192 κάλλεϊ μὲν οἱ πρῶτα
προσώπατα καλὰ κάθηρεν Ι ἀμβροσίῳ, οἵῳ
περ ἐϋστέφανος Κυθέρεια Ι χρίεται, εὖτ'
ἂν ἴῃ Χαρίτων χορὸν ἱμερόεντα. But it is
much more likely that traces of Sophocles
can be recovered from Callimachus, Lav.
Pall. 15 ff., whose picture reproduces
exactly the details mentioned by Athenaeus:

<p>Meineke thinks that from Sophocles
came the description of Pallas running
in the stadium, as well as the comparison
of her blush to the morning rose or the
flower of the pomegranate. See also on
fr. 785.</p>
<p>ΚΩΦ0Ι ΣΑΤΥΡΟΙ</p>
<p>The subject of this play is unknown: Welcker (Nachtr.
p. 295) conjectured that the ‘dumb’ men were homicides under
a ban of silence, possibly on account οf the murder of Icarius.
This is not very likely, if the κωφοί composed the chorus. I
should rather be inclined to guess that the κωφοί were ‘block-
heads’ (Hesych. 11 p. 566 κωφόν· ἀναίσθητον μωρόν: cf. schol. Ai.
911 ὁ πάντα κωφός . . . ἐγὼ δέ, φησίν, ὁ ἀναίσθητος κατημέλησα),
like Maccus and Bucco in the Oscan Atellanae (Marx in Pauly-
Wissowa I 1918), or the stupidus of the later mime (Juv. 8. 197).
Perhaps we may compare βλεννόν· τὸν νωθῆ καὶ μωρὸν Σώφρων
Προμηθεῖ (Epicharm. fr. 119 K.). Wagner, who anticipated this
suggestion, inferred from fr. 362 that the subject was the gift of
fire by Prometheus to the satyrs, who provoked laughter by their
clumsiness and stupidity in using it. Headlam, who also thought
of Prometheus (J. P.`xxxi 9), understood the title to refer to
the condition of the satyrs before their eyes were opened (cf.
Aesch. Prom. 463).</p>

The myth therefore was an old one :
Nicander prefaces his version in Ther.
343 — 358 with ὠγύγιος δ’ ἄρα μῦθος ἐν
αἰζηοῖσι φορεῖται.</p>
<p>We have here one of those beast fables,
which are still told among the Arabs, to
account for the peculiarities of various
animals. Prometheus gave the stolen
fire to Man, but (according to one version)
they were dissatisfied because he had not
endowed them with perpetual youth; at
any rate, they foolishly informed against
their benefactor ; and Zeus rewarded
them with an antidote against old age.
They put the precious burden on an ’s
back to carry. It was hot weather, and
the Ass, coming to a spring, besought
the Snake who guarded it to let him
drink. The Snake — a διψάς — said, “ I
will do so on condition that you give me
what you are carrying on your back. ” So
they exchanged ; and hence the διψάς
every year renews his youth by casting
his slough (ἀποδύεται τὸ γῆρας is
regular phrase), — but he also got the
’s thirst, which his bite inflicts upon
his victims’</p>
<p>For the popular belief that the water
of a spring is guarded by a snake cf.
Eur. Phoen. 657 ἔνθα φόνιος ἦν δράκων

as the Dragon Water : see Frazer's Pausanias

parts of the world are collected by the
same writer in vol. V p. 44 f. The
precious burden entrusted to the donkey,
and consequently imperilled, recalls the

according to one of its interpretations

often localized in Crete, but there is also

<pb n="33"/>
strong evidence placing their home on
Mt Ida in the Troad, The oldest is
that of the epic Phoronis (fr. 2 K.) ἔνθα

appears to be one of the authorities which
Sophocles followed in this and the following
fragments. Ephorus also testified to
the Phrygian origin of the Dactyls: Diod.

litt. Gr. p. 370: om. Zenob.) σατύροις.
Unfortunately this passage is mutilated:
I have added the words Sre and ἐξενίζετο
which seem to be demanded by the sense,
but we also require the finite verb to
which Κέλμις was the subject, describing
the punishment awarded to him for his
arrogance and impiety. Celmis is the
first name among the Dactyls according
to the Phoronis (l.c.), and is mentioned
with Damnameneus as chief of the
Idaean Dactyls who discovered iron in
Cyprus by Clem. Alex, strom. i p. 362
(EGF p. 150). In Nonnus 14. 39 he
appears as one of the Telchins : Gruppe
identifies him with Σκέλμις, one of Poseidon's
attendants in Nonn. 37. 164 etc.,
and connects the name with σκάλμη·
μάχαιρα Hesych. IV. p. 37 (Gr. Myth.
p. 8842). But in Ov. Met. 4. 281 we
have a trace of the story here alluded to :
te quoque, nunc a damas, quondam fidissime
Ι Celmi, lovi, where it will be
observed that adainas answers to ὁ στερεώτατος
σίδηρος, but Juppiter has taken
the place of Rhea as the offended deity.
It seems to follow that Celmis was turned
into iron as a punishment for insulting
Rhea. Rhea is here spoken of as the
mother of the Dactyls; but Nonn. 14. 26
identifies them with the Corybantes, and
calls them γηγενέες, explaining that Rhea
ἐΚ χθονὸς αὐτοτέλεστον ἀνεβλάστησε γενέθλην.
Usually, however, they are described
as attendants or assistants of Rhea,
who, as mistress of the heights of Ida,
made use of their labours to work the
metallic ore buried beneath the mountain :
Pollux 2. 156, Diod. 17. 7, Strabo 473.
The welcome given by the Dactyls to
the goddess on the occasion of one of
her visits to them was related by Hellanicus
in schol. Ap. Rhod. 1. 1129

<p>The story of the play was taken from the Little Iliad of
Lesches, and is summarized in the epitome of Proclus (EGF
p. 27) : καὶ μετὰ ravra (i.e. after the visit of Odysseus to Troy
disguised as a beggar, when he was recognized by Helen and
made arrangements with her for the capture of the city) avv
Διομήδει τὸ Παλλάδιον ἐκκομίζει ἐΚ τῆς Ἰλίου. The order of
events agrees with the evidence of Arist poet. 23. 1459 b 6, where
in a list of tragedies taken from the Little Iliad the πτωχεία — an
otherwise unknown title — immediately precedes the Λάκαιναι.
The occasion is identified beyond question by fr. 367, as explained
by the authorities which are quoted in the note 1.</p>
<p>The epitome of Proclus suggests that the information which
induced Odysseus and Diomedes to undertake their dangerous
adventure was derived from Helen by Odysseus on his previous
visit. This was to the effect that the possession of the Palladium
by the Greeks was essential to their success. According to
ApoUod. epit. 5. 10 Helenus was captured on Mt Ida by Odysseus,
and, when brought into the Greek camp, was forced to
reveal this secret, together with other information concerning
the conditions necessary to the capture of the city. The same
tradition is followed by Conon 34 and Qu. Smyrn. 10. 350. On
the other hand, there are several passages recording that the
theft of the image was promoted by the treachery of Antenor,
who not only informed the Greeks of its importance, but also
with the assistance of his wife Theano actually surrendered it to

them (Diet. 5. 5. 8, schol. B Horn. Z 311, Suid. s.v. Παλλάδιον).
There is nothing to show how Sophocles arranged these incidents,
and it is doubtful whether the coraphcity of Antenor, which is
inconsistent with his character as portrayed in Homer, was first
introduced in one of the Cyclic epics, by the Attic tragedians, or
some later writer 1. Nevertheless, fr. 368 is particularly appro-
priate if addressed to Theano, as the custodian of the image 2
in order to induce her to hand it over. It is highly improbable
that Odysseus and Diomede removed the statue by violent entry
into the temple in the crude fashion suggested by Conon's narrative 3
but, on the other hand, their success does not necessarily
imply that Theano and Antenor, or either of them, were actuated
by dishonourable motives.</p>
<p>The Spartan women, of whom the chorus consisted, must be
taken to be the attendants of Helen ; for no others can be thought
of as likely to be present in Troy. Their sympathies would
naturally be enlisted in favour of the enterprise, and the home
of Helen was a rendezvous to which the two adventurers would
be likely to resort, especially if the theft had previously been
arranged with her 4. Fr. 957, which is attributed to the play by
Welcker and others, is suitable to Helen; but the source of
fr. 768 N. is now known to have been the EurypylnSy and the suppoition
that fr. 745 is addressed to Antenor is a mere guess.</p>
<p>A much more important question arises in reference to
’s suggestion that fr. 799 belongs to the Lacaenae. The
extract is taken from a speech of Odysseus attacking Diomedes ;
and there is no record of a quarrel between these heroes except
on the occasion of their return to the Greek camp after the theft
of the Palladium 5. Diomedes was carrying the image, which he
had managed to secure, but Odysseus wished to enjoy the sole
credit of the achievement and treacherously attempted to murder
his comrade. Diomedes, however, saw the flash of his sword in
time to ward off the blow, and, in order to prevent a repetition
of the trick, made Odysseus walk in front of him with his arms
bound, driving him into the camp by blows with the flat of his

sword. Hence, it was said, arose the proverb Διομήδειος ἀνάγκη,
as applied to those who were forced to act against their wilP.
The strength of Welcker's case is materially increased by a gloss
of Hesychius (l p. 517), which, though unfortunately incomplete,
proves that something of the kind was related in the Little Iliad
(fr. 9 K.). It is obvious that this story was ill-suited to dramatic
representation, and it may be conjectured that the two heroes
contended with words rather than with blows for the possession
of the prize. Somehow or other their strife must have been
composed before they left the scene, possibly by the intervention
of the goddess herself</p>
<p>Fr. 799 has not been included under this title, since its
ascription to the Lacaenae is, after all, hardly more than a
plausible conjecture.</p>

δανοτῆτος δανότητος Lehrs) is an obscure
word, and by most critics treated as
corrupt. The accentuation adopted by
Lehrs follows the authority of Herodian
I p. 83, 8 Lentz, where δανότης occurs in
a list of nouns introduced by the words
τὸ εἰς #x772; πολυσύλλαβα θηλθκὰ βαρύνονται
(not quoted by Chandler, § 635).
It is not quite clear what Herodian intends
to say. J. thinks he suggested
that δανοτής might be formed from a
proper name ; but the words et παρ᾿ ἄνομα
σχηματισθείη certainly mean, ‘if it were
formed from a noun.’ The
ὄνομα includes our adjective (Dionys.
Thrax p. 23 Uhlig); and Lehrs, whom
Lentz follows, thought that Herodian
intended to refer to a suggested derivation

<pb n="38"/>
from the adverb δάν in the sense of χρο- favour. Much better is Duentzer's δαϊονιότης.
But the natural inference is τῆτος (also proposed by Herwerden),
rather that he was in the dark about which should be provisionally accepted.

parched, occurs in Horn. O 322. Hence suggests (partly after üster) that the

<p>ΛΑΟΚΟΩΝ</p>
<p>The earliest mention of the Laocoon-story is in the Iliupersis
of Arctinus (EGF p. 49). When the Greeks had withdrawn to
Tenedos, leaving the wooden horse behind them, the Trojans
held high festival in the belief that the war was over. During
the progress of the feast two serpents appeared, and killed
Laocoon with one of his sons. Aeneas and his family, alarmed
by the omen, fled to Mt Ida. It has been inferred from this
statement1 that the death of the elder son of Laocoon typified
the downfall of Priam, who sprang from Ilus, the eldest son of
Tros ; whereas the escape of Aeneas, the descendant of Assaracus,
a younger son of Tros (ApoUod. 3. 140), was symbolized
by the escape of the younger son of Laocoon. Anyhow, the
introduction of the τέρας into the narrative of the Iliupersis
served the purpose of supplying a motive for the emigration
of Aeneas and his kindred from Troy to Ida. Dionysius of
Halicarnassus (fr. 373) provides a connecting link between
Sophocles and Arctinus, by stating that Aeneas was represented
in the Laocoon as removing to Ida by the advice of his
father Anchises, who inferred the impending destruction of
Troy not merely from his recollection of Aphrodite's behests,
but also in part from the warnings recently given περὶ τοὺς
Λαοκοωντίδας. From the last words Robert draws the important
inference that Sophocles differed from Arctinus in
<note type="footnote">1 The literary history of the myth of Laocoon, including the treatment by Sophocles,
is discussed by C. Robert, bild υ. Lied. esp. at p. 192 ff.</note>

<pb n="39"/>
making both the sons of Laocoon perish, while Laocoon himself
survived1. He argues that Dionysius was not guilty of a
careless inexactitude of expression, since the greater number of
the authorities agree in stating that both sons were destroyed2.
Lessing long since pointed out that Vergil was the first and
only poet who represented both the father and the two sons
as perishing, and Robert is of the same opinion3. Thus the
famous Vatican group can have nothing to do with the play
of Sophocles4. Robert proceeds to trace the influence of the
Sophoclean version in Lycophr. 347 καὶ παιδοβρῶτος Πορκέως
νήσους διπλᾶς, where the serpent is described as 
‘childdevouring.’</p>
<p>Servius on Verg. Aen. en. 2. 204 (fr. 372) states that Sophocles
in the Laocoon gave the names of the serpents, and the same
authority (n. on fr. 372) cites the actual names from Lysimachus
in the Nosti as Curifis and Periboea. These names are, in all
probability, a corruption of Πόρκις and Χαρίβοια, as they are
recorded by Tzetzes on Lycophr. 344. Now, since Sophocles
named the serpents, Robert infers that Sophocles was the source
of Lysimachus, and also of the scholium on Lycophron. But
the scholiast further describes the serpents as ‘having sailed’
(πλεύσαντες) from the Calydnae islands, which recalls the treatment
of Bacchylides (fr. 51 J. = 32 B.) as recorded by Servius on
Verg. Aen. 2. 201 sane Bacchylides de Laocoonte et uxore eius vel
de serpentibus a Calydnis insulis venientibus atque in homines
conversis dicit. It seems impossible to give a satisfactory explanation
of these remarkable statements. Welcker, who first
called attention to the points of contact between the authorities,
observed that, if Sophocles mentioned their names, it must have
<note type="footnote">1 The validity of this reasoning was impugned by R. Foerster ( Verhandlungen
der 40 Versammlung deutscher Philologen in Gorlitz, 1889, p. 432 ff.), who argued that

sons. He quoted (among other examples) the use of Aeneadae in Verg. Aen. 1. 157

killed by the serpents which swam across from Calydna; but the father survived.

(in Roscher 11 1839) about 150 B.C. Robert, who states (p. 212) that there is
no representation of Laocoon in Greek art of the best time, puts it in the reign of
Titus. Engelmann (Arch. Stud., 1900, p. 25), however, thinks that the group was
influenced by Sophocles, and that Vergil in turn modelled his description on the
group. Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 6896, takes a similar view, holding that Soph, combined
the Iliupersis story with the version which spoke of the sons only as destroyed.
The latter was adopted by Bacchylides, whom Apollodorus and Quintus followed.</note>

been because the serpents changed into men; for there could
be no other object in recording the names. Robert, however,
mainly on the ground that the word πλεύσαντες could not
suitably be applied to serpents, concluded that they came over
in human form and were afterwards changed into serpents, —
thus attributing to Sophocles a tradition which is the exact
converse of the version of Bacchylides. But this conjecture is
not only improbable in itself, but inconsistent with the epitome
of Apollodorus (5. 18), which by various touches shows its connexion
with the Lycophron-scholia : δύο γὰρ δράκοντς διανηξάμενοι

in error for Capys) and brother of Anchises, was a priest
of Apollo who had incurred the anger of the god for disobeying
him by marrying and begetting children. The names of his
sons are given as Antiphates and Thymbraeus2. The cause of
’s anger is differently given by Servius on Verg. Aen.
2. 201, who says that Laocoon had profaned the temple at
Thymbra, ante simulacrum numinis cum Antiopa uxore sua
coeundo. Now, the Lycophron-scholia make the temple of
Apollo Thymbraeus the scene of the disaster, and also differ
from Hyginus in making Laocoon the son of Antenor3. Hence
Robert, who had already identified Sophocles as the source of
the scholiast, concludes that the circumstances of Laocoon's
guilt, as given by Servius, were also derived from Sophocles,
arguing that it was a favourite tragic motive to localize the
punishment at the place of the offence. He also considers that
Sophocles derived from Bacchylides the idea that Laocoon had
sinned against Apollo, as well as the version that both his sons
(but not he himself) perished4.</p>
<p>Probably the opening of the play described the rejoicings
of the Trojans at the supposed departure of the Greeks (fr. 370),
and perhaps also the debate as to what should be done with
the wooden horse, in which Cassandra and Laocoon may have
uttered a warning of the impending danger but without success
(Apollod. 5. 17). It seems that a sacrifice to Poseidon in grati-

<note type="footnote">2 Robert holds that the text of Hyginus has been considerably interpolated from
Vergil, i.e. from Aen. 2. 201, 203, 231. Μ. Schmidt (p. xxv) regarded the whole
chapter as an interpolation by someone who was more familiar with Vergil and Ovid
than with the Greek sources. Foerster, however, argues strenuously in favour of its
genuineness, and since, for various reasons, it cannot have been derived from Arctinus,
Bacchylides, or Euphorion, he concludes that it must contain the version of Sophocles.</note>

tude for removing their enemies was resolved upon (fr. 371)1,
and Laocoon was perhaps instructed to carry it out. The subsequent
catastrophe must have been reported by a messenger,
and either the same or another messenger announced the departure
of Aeneas (fr. 373). That Laocoon had sinned against
Apollo, as stated by Servius, is probable enough ; but it is
difficult to conceive him as merely the passive victim of destiny
throughout the whole course of the action. In other words,
the early transgression is too remote to serve as a dramatic
justification for the περιπέτεια; one would rather suspect that
Laocoon by some fresh demonstration of ὕβρις proved that the
time was ripe for divine vengeance. Το have hurled a spear
at the wooden horse is in itself not enough to convict him of
impiety (Aen. 2. 229 ff.) ; but the circumstances of the act may
well have been such as to stamp it with the mark of reckless
arrogance. Laocoon, the μάντις, was perhaps a scoffer who
ridiculed the notion of divine interference. Although there is
no direct evidence of this in our authorities, the character of
Laocoon so far as it may be gathered from Vergil and Quintus
is quite consistent with such a supposition.

<p>1 ff. The text presents serious difficulties.
It is at once clear that the first
μέδεις must have been erroneously inserted,
since it cannot govern the accusative
πρῶνας. There is a further stumblingblock
in the fact that πρῶνας in Aristophanes
has no construction, and it is
hard to say whether the text of Aristophanes
has been corrupted from the
scholium or vice versa; the possibility
that the two errors have occurred in-
dependently is more remote. None of
the critics has satisfactorily accounted
for the double blot. Tucker's remedy,
which is the best that has been proposed,
assumes the loss of περί in its abbrevi-
ρ
ated form tt in both texts; but he does
not say whether he regards this as a
coincidence, or considers one omission to
have led to the other. J., supporting

to Plato) οἵδε ποτ᾿ Αἰγαίοιο

unnecessarily proposes ὕδατος. — πρῶνας:
it has been suggested that πρών here is
an inlet or gulf of the sea, as αλιον πρῶνα
is sometimes taken to be the Hellespont
in Aesch. Pers. 135, 882. There is no
need, however, to give up the ordinary
rendering, headland. It was usual for
temples of Poseidon to be erected upon
promontories : hence Ar. Eq. 560 ὦ δελφίνων
μεδέων, Σουνιάρατε, ὦ Γεραίστιε παῖ
Κρόνου, Ach. 510 οὐπὶ Ταινάρῳ δεός. J.
remarks : ‘ σπιλάδεσσι has its proper
sense, sea-rocks. Sophocles spoke of
Poseidon here as (I) ruling over πρῶνες,

<pb n="43"/>
as at Sunium etc.: (2) or, surveying the
blue expanse of the open sea from the
rocks amidst the waves to which he has
risen from the depths.’ — μέδεις,
occurs also in Ant. 11 19, is regarded by
some as an archaistic re- formation after
the substantival μέδων : see Smyth, Gk.
Me lic Poets , p. 213.</p>
<p>στομάτων is generally considered to be
corrupt, and most critics have required
a participle in its place. H., who had
abandoned his earlier proposal to read
Σουνιτῶν or Σουνιατῶν, referring to Aesch.
Cho. 802 ὧ μέγα ναίων στόμιον, suspected
that by στομάτων the gateways to the
underworld were meant. This will
hardly do without some specification
either express or implied in the context.
What if Ταιναρίων followed, and this
were the original of Vergil's Taenarias
fauces (Georg. 4. 467)? So Pind. Pyth.
4. 43 πὰρ χθόνιον Ἄιδα στόμα, Ταίναρον
εἰς ἱεράν. But there is another possibility
which deserves mention. The worship
of Poseidon on promontories was often
connected with the existence of a secure
harbour of refuge in the immediate
neighbourhood. This appears most
clearly in Eur. Cycl. 290 ff. οἱ τὸν σόν,
ὦναξ, πατέρ᾿ ἔχειν νεῶν ναῶν Canter) ἕδρας |
ippvadfxecrda γῆς ἐν Ἐλλάδος μυχοῖς. Ι

Μαλέας τ’ ἄκροι κευθμῶνες ἤ τε Σουνίου
| δίας Ἀθάνας σῶς ὑπάργυρος πέρα |
Γεραίστιοί τε Karacpvyai. Hence the
titles ἀσφάλειος, πανασφάλιος, σωσινέως
and the like: the details are collected
by Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 1158. Now
ἀυανέμου, on the ordinary view, is either
(a) breezy or (b) calm, — without much
obvious point. But in Eur. Andr. 749
λιμένας εὐηνέμους = sheltered harbours.
We might then translate: ’Who boldest
sway on lofty crags over the entrance to
the blue waters of the sheltered cove.’
In any case, I think, Bergk’s transposition
στομάτων σπιλάσεσσι should be accepted
for metrical reasons. This error is very
common, and the enhoplic rhythm of
vv. 2 , 3 can hardly be mistaken : the
first line, whether to be called enhoplic
or logaoedic, should be compared with
O.C. 210 or Ai. 399 (Schroeder). εὐάνεμος
always has #x772;, probably even in At.
197, except in Α. P. 9. 555 (Crinagoras,
ctrc. B.C. 21 — A.D. 9) εὐάνεμον λιμένων τ’
ἤπιον ἀτρεμίῃ, — a passage which also
illustrates the rendering suggested above.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p>[draconum nomina.]</p>
<p>372 Servius on Verg. Aen. 2. 204
(speaking of the serpents which attacked
Laocoon) horum sane draconum nomina
Sophocles in Laocoonte dicit.</p>
<p>Nauck discredits this statement altogether,
and thinks that it is due to confusion
of Sophocles himself with the
scholiasts who commented on his text.
This attitude, which he supports by a
reference to Aesch. fr. 376, Eur. fr. 10 16
and other passages, cannot be approved.
The names are by by Tzetzes on
Lycophr. 344 as Πόρκις and Χαρίβοια.
Serv. on Verg. Aen. 2. 211, quoting as
his authority Lysimachus — an Alexandrian
writer belonging to the second or
first century B.C. — in the Νόστοι (FHG
III 240), presents them in the disguised
form of curifis and Periboea (curifin et
periboeam : Thilo conj. Porcen ofin ὄφιν]
et Chariboeam). Lycophr. 347 has καὶ
παιδοβρῶτος Πορκέως νήσους διπλᾶς,
referring to the Calydnae.</p>
<p>H. points out that the serpent who
guarded the apples of the Hesperides is
named Ladon by Apoll. Rhod. 4. 1396.
C. Keil (Anal. Epigr. 191 n.) adds
Glycon, the name of a snake in Lucian
Alex. 18.</p>

prefers νώτου, which he assigns to Turnebus.
Bernardakis prints νώτου without
mentioning any variant. Weil suggests
βρότου. It appears that most of Plut.'s
MSS have μοτοῦ, the Riccardianus alone
νώτου (Nauck, Paton).</p>

the Introductory Note.</p>
<p>2 f. ἐπ᾿ ὤμων: there is very little
doubt that this touch, which is explained
by the allusion of κεραυνίου, goes back
to Arctinus. The oldest evidence relating
to it appears to be that of a coin of the
town Aineia in Macedonia belonging to
the sixth century B.C., on which Aeneas is
represented carrying his father on his
shoulders, with his wife beside him
carrying a child in like manner (Baumeister,
Denkmäler, fig. 1015). Cf.
Apollod. epit. 5. 21 Αἰνείας δὲ Ἀγχίσην
τὸν πατέρα βαστάσας ἔφυγε. — κεραυνίου.
‘Anchises had been struck with lightning
for divulging his intercourse with Venus.
In the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite, the
goddess speaks thus to Anchises (v. 286):
εἰ δέ κεν ἐξείπῃς καὶ ἐπεύξεαι ἄφρονι
θυμῷ | ἐν φιλότητι μιγῆναι ἐσυτεφάνῳ
Κυθερείῃ, | Zeus σε χολωσάμενος βαλέει
ψολόεντι κεραυνῷ. Verg. Aen. 2. 648
(Anchises speaks) ex quo me dinom pater
atque hominum rex | fulminis adflavit
ventis et contigit igni.’ (J.) Allen
Sikes suggest that the story is late, on the
ground that it appears first in Hyginus;
but Rossbach (in Pauly-Wissowa 1 2107)
seems to be justified in tracing it to the
old epic saga. The alternative account
that Anchises was blinded by the lightning
is ascribed to Theocritus by Servius on
Aen. 2. 35. See Wilamowitz, Textgesch.
d. Bukol. p. 233.</p>
<p>νώτου. . φάρος. Plutarch's ἰχῶρα πονηρὸν
ἐξεδίδου leaves no doubt that he
understood Sophocles as affirming that
the robe of Anchises was stained by the
discharge from his wound. So the words
are taken by Wyttenbach, and by J., who
quotes for the ace. after καταστάζω Phil.
823 ἰδρώς γέ τοι νιν πᾶν καταστάζει δέμας,
and Eur. Hec. 241 φόνου σταλαγμοὶ σὴν

<pb n="45"/>
κατέσταζον γένυν. But this view fails to
account for the genitive νώτου, for which
no parallel can be adduced. And, if
the words mean ‘dropping (matter) from
his palsied back over his linen robe,’ it
is very odd that the most important word
(ἰχῶρα or the like) should be omitted.
If this line of interpretation is followed,
the loss of a verse must be assumed.
But the assumption is unnecessary, for
the words can naturally be explained
‘letting his linen robe drop over his
back.’ Wyttenbach, who mentions this
as an alternative version, calls it ‘durior
metaphora’: but cf. Hom. B 734 πέπλον
μὲν κατέχευεν ἑανὸν πατρὸς ἐπ᾿ οὔδει,
Aesch. Αγ. 230 κρόκου βαφὰς δ’ ἐς πὲδον
χέουσα. I am glad to find that the same
view was taken by Meineke on Callim.
h. Deni. 5 μηδ’ ἃ κατεχεύατο
W. R. Paton in C. R. xxv 204, adopting
μοτοῦ and reading κεραύνιον (coll. Ant.
1139) understands ‘staining the fine coat
of Aeneas with the discharge from his
rag-bandage.’ It may perhaps
hazardous to assume that Plutarch misunderstood
Sophocles, but I believe that
νώτου and μοτοῦ were old rivals, and
that Plutarch chose the inferior. The
intrinsic superiority of ὤτου, as interpreted
above, seems to me unquestionable:
the punishment of Anchises was long
ago, and surely he had not suffered from
a running sore ever since. Besides, on
’s view, μοτοῦ is scarcely less harsh
than νώτου. And why does Paton speak
more than once of a ‘purple cloak’? Anyhow,
this is scarcely a case for correction
ἀτμοῦ Burges, λύθρῳ or ἀφρῷ Blaydes).
— βύσσινον φάρος, ‘meant to be oriental
and barbarian. In Aesch. Pers. 128
βυσσίνοις πέπλοις are the garb of the
Persian mourners. Eur. Bacch. 821 Δι.
στεῖλαί νυν ἀμφὶ χρωτὶ βυσσίνους πέπλους.
ΠΕ. τί δὴ τόδ᾿; ἐς γυναῖκας ἐξ ἀνδρὸς πελῶ;’
(J.) The latter passage shows that
βύσσος was also the delicate wear of
women: so Aesch. Theb. 1030, Theocr.
2. 73, fr. 439 n. This explanation sufficiently
accounts for φάρος, which is not
elsewhere in tragedy applied to male
attire, without supposing that it denotes
a gift of Aphrodite to Aeneas (Mekler in
Jahresb. CXXIX 81).</p>
<p>4 κυκλοῖ. See cr. n. Nauck and
Dindorf adopted Reiske's κύκλῳ (which
however Jacoby attributes to B), but
Hense rightly objected to a reading which
involves a clumsy syllepsis of even
if it does not seem to assert that Aeneas
carried all his household, as well as his
father, on his back. ’s own
remedy κυκλεῖ δὲ πάντων. . . and Blaydes's
κυκλεῖ δὲ συμπᾶσ᾿. . . fail to remove the
inelegant repetition of πᾶς. I have substituted
δ᾿ ἀναστᾶσ᾿ (i.e. ἀνάστατος γενομένη),
which gives an appropriate meaning
(cf. Eur. Hec. 494), and might easily have
been corrupted to δὲ πᾶσαν: the accusative
παμπληθίαν was a consequential error.
It is impossible to accept Ellendt's view
that κυκλεῖ means ‘secum volvit, i.e. turba
circumfusus ingreditur.’ Papageorgius
rightly gave the preference to κυκλοῖ, for
the lexicons will show that κυκλεῖν cannot
be used for ‘to encircle.’ —
has been objected to (see cr. n.), as
ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, and because πλῆθος occurs
i the next line. But something must
be allowed to accident, and παμπληθία
is hardly the word to have been introduced
as a gloss. Blaydes compares πολυπληθίᾳ
fr. 667 and ἀνδροπληθία Aesch. Pers.
238. See also on fr. 915.</p>
<p>5 συνοπάζεται. ‘The anapaest in
the first foot, in a word of more than
three syllables, is rare, though not incorrect
(cp. Ο. Τ. 20 ἀγοραῖσι θακεῖ).
συμπλάζεται = συμπλανᾶται, “wanders
forth with him,” emigrates from Troy.’
(J.) — Bergk's γάρ (see cr. n.) is attractive
but unnecessary: see on fr. 576, 4. —
οὐχ ὅσον δοκεῖς can hardly be right. Its
natural meaning would be ‘less than you
think’: cf. Eur. Tro. 864 ἦλθον
Τροίαν οὐχ ὅσον δοκεῖτέ με | γυνακὸς
εἴνεκ’. Herwerden's conjecture restores
a familiar Greek idiom, πόσν δοκεῖς
being strictly parenthetic: cf. Ar. Eccl.
399 ὁ δῆμος ἀναβοᾷ, πόσον δοκεῖς; Pac.
704 χἅτερα πόσ᾿ ἅττ᾿ οἴει γεγενῆσθ᾿ ἐν τῇ

colloquial, ‘you can't think how large,’
but we have πῶς δοκεῖς in tragedy also at
Eur. Hipp. 446, Hec. 1160 (l. A. 1590 is
a late forgery). The latter passage ἐΚ
γαληνῶν πῶς δοκεῖς προσφθεγμάτων, ‘as
peaceful as you will,’ is strangely
by some.</p>

<p>Though the words are simple enough,
their exact intention has puzzled the
critics. Thus Dobree proposed οἱ λόγοι
γλυκεῖς or ἡ μνήμη γλυκύ, doubtless with
the object of producing a closer correspondence
with the well-known line of
Euripides (fr. 133) ἀλλ᾿ ἡδύ τοι σωθέντα
μεμνῆσθαι πόνων. See also the illustrations
quoted on Eur. Hel. 665 ἡδύ τοι
μόχθων κλύειν. But, if we compare
Antisth. ap. Stob. flor. 29. 65 ἡδονὰς
τὰς τερὰ τοὺς πόνους διωκτένο, ἀλλ᾿ οὐΧὶ
τὰς πρὸ τῶν πόνων, remembering that it
was Antisthenes who said μανείην μᾶλλον
ἢ ἡσθείην, the point might appear to
that labour brings its own reward with
it. Aesch. Ag. 798 εὔφρων πόνος εὖ
τελέσασιν. Hence Ellendt's κόπου μεταλλαχθέντος
and Meineke's μόχθου δ᾿ ἀπαλλαχθέντος.
H. would have agreed with
Meineke as against Ellendt on the ground
that πόνου, κόπου or μόχθου requires a
verb meaning to abate, cease; whereas
μεταλλάσσειν is to shift, change, alter.
He accordingly approved πότμου μεταλλαχθέντος
(Nauck had conjectured πότμου
μεταβληθέντος), comparing fr. 871. 2
Aesch. Theb. 692 δαίμων. . . μεταλλακτός
(in a metaphor from a changing wind),
Pers. 944 δαίμων γὰρ ὅδ᾿ αὖ μετάτροπος
ἐπ᾿ ἐμοί (schol. ἡ τύχη μεταβέβληται),
Eur. Tro. 101 μεταβαλλομένου δαίμονος
ἀνέχου. Dinarch. 1. 92
τὴν τύχην Καὶ μεταλλάξασθαι. Similar is
the intention of Tucker's πνόου, a word
not to be lightly introduced. On the
other hand Hense, who does not alter
the text, evidently approves the meaning
‘a change of labour is sweet.’ Only
context could decide, but I am not satisfied
that πόνου μεταλλαχθέντος cannot
express a change from labour to ease.
Thus Eur. Her. 734 μεταβολὰ ΚαΚῶν
probably signifies a release from suffering,
and there is no doubt about the meaning
of Eur. fr. 864 παίζω· μεταβολὰς γὰρ
πόνων ἀεὶ φιλῶ, and of Soph. fr. 314, 217
μετάστασις πόνων. Gomperz defends his
conjecture οἱ γόοι for οἱ πόνοι by the
Homeric γόῳ φρένα τέρπομαι and γλυκὺν
ἵμερον ὦρσε γόοιο, and other passages in
tragedy; but this is less attractive, as
the pleasure of weeping does not depend
on the cessation of suffering. Stadtmueller's
οἰ πότοι γλυκεῖς is certainly to
be rejected.</p>

Meineke reads πόνου for μόχθου, connecting
this with the last fr. (see n.).
Similarly Holzner conjectured ἡδύς for
οὐδείς. Dindorf also concludes that the
two lines are to be read together. But
in fact they do not fit each other: here
the point is that no sooner is a sorrow
past than it is forgotten. Cf. Pind. Isth.

phrase which Herodotus employs more

Aesch. Prom. 247 βροτῶν δὲ τῶν ταλαιπώρων

Blom field in loc.), Eur. fr. 94 τῶν γὰρ

541 οὐΚ ἂν ἤν λόγος σέθεν — an example
which shows that it is sometimes difficult
to separate this meaning from that of
speech, reputation (l.T. 517). Sophocles
has also οὐΚ ἂν πριαίμην οὐδενὸς λόγου
βροτόν κτἑ. Ai. 477, and μὴ φῦναι τὸν
ἄπαντα νικᾷ λόγου O.C. 1225 (Jebb's n).
Both the sense and the language are illustrated

Diomedean birds, if barbarians land in
their island, ἀνίπτασθαι καὶ αἰωρουμένους

These birds were called cataractae by
some authorities: Plin. h. n. 10. 126.
Lycophron, who has κίρκου καταρρακτῆρος
(169), compares Paris to a bird of prey

<p>ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙΟΙ</p>
<p>There can be no reasonable doubt that the subject of this
play was the final issue of the story of Acrisius and Danae.
According to Pherecydes in schol. Ap. Rhod. 4. 1090 (FHG
I 76), Perseus, leaving Dictys as sovereign of all the Seriphians
who were not destroyed by the ’s head, returned to Argos
with his wife and mother. But Acrisius was no longer there;
for, in fear of the oracle that he would be slain by his ’s
son, he had withdrawn to the Pelasgian town of Larisa. Perseus
followed him there, made himself known to his grandfather, and
persuaded him to accompany him to Argos. But before his
departure Perseus was a competitor in a local athletic contest
which included quoit-throwing. It so happened that the discus
thrown by Perseus, rebounding after its fall, wounded the foot of
Acrisius, who sickened and died at Larisa. This plot is clearly
indicated by frs. 378 and 379, and from the former it appears

<pb n="48"/>
that Acrisius himself gave the games,—probably in honour of
the reconciliation with his grandson. The account in Apollod.
2. 47, which agrees almost word for word with Zenob. 1. 41, is
much shorter, but states that the games were held by Teutamidas,
the king of Larisa, on the occasion of his father’s funeral,
and that Perseus came to Larisa with the express object of contending.
On the other hand, Pausan. 2. 16. 2 says that Perseus
came to Larisa because he wished to see his mother’s father, and
‘to show him kindness by word and deed.’ He makes no reference
to the games, but merely states that Perseus, in the pride of
youth, rejoicing at the discovery of the discus, gave a public
display of his skill. Apollodorus speaks of the contest as the
pentathlon, but Pherecydes goes out of his way to deny that
the pentathlon had then been established. A late variation of
the story is given by Hygin. 63, in which the scene is transferred
from Larisa to Seriphus, on the occasion of the funeral
games held after the death of Polydectes. The discus was
carried out of its proper direction by the wind, and broke the
head of Acrisius,</p>
<p>The similarity of the circumstances to the Amyclean legend
of Hyacinthus and Apollo should be observed: see Eur. Hel.
1469 ff. (n.).</p>

<p>1 πάγξενον (see cr. n.) is probably

γλαύκᾳ στεφανωσάμενον. For Sophocles’
fondness for compounds with πᾶς see
Jebb on Trach. 661.—ἀγῶνα here is
gathering rather than contest, as in Hom.
Ω 10 and elsewhere.—κηρύσσεται:
middle is best treated as causative ‘had
proclaimed’; but it should be recognized
that this is only a special application,
suggested by the context, of the essential
subjectivity which belongs to the middle
voice. See the excellent account given
by E. S. Thompson on Plat. Men. 93 D.
The partiality of Sophocles for the middle
voice is well known: parallel cases are
O. T. 556 πέμψασθαι, Phil. 944 φήνασθαι,
frs. 16, 941. According to the other
authorities it was Teutamidas, and not
Acrisius, who gave the funeral games:
see Introductory Note.</p>
<p>χαλκηλάτους λέβητας, ‘cauldrons,
kettles, of bronze, on stands (τρίποδες).

<p>3 κοῖλα is suspected by Kaibel, but
without sufficient cause. It is a technical
term of art, where the convex figures
produced by the chasing of the baser
metal are overlaid with gold (or silver);
and helps here to distinguish the cups
with gold ornamentation from those which
are of solid silver. So χρυσοκόλλητον
δέπας and χp. κάλπις in Antiphanes (fr.
237, II 115 K. and fr. 106, 11 53 K.):
Athenaeus saw at Capua a cup dedicated

<p>The eponymous heroine of the Thessalian
town was herself the daughter of
Pelasgus (Hellan. fr. 29 FHG I 49), and
the acropolis at Argos was called Larisaea
after her (Pausan. 2. 24. I). She fell
into the Peneios, while playing ball
(Eustath. Od. p. 1554, 34). For repre-
sentations of her head on Thessalian
coins see B. V. Head, Hist. Num2.
p. 299. Larisa was also the name given
to the wife of Cyzicus (Parthen. 28). —
irpoo-yovtrtv was evidently a puzzle, and
the grammarian’s solution that σ&#x772;
redundant shows that he understood the
meaning to be ‘(our) Pelasgian ancestors.’
Nauck judged the word to be ‘sine dubio
vitiosum.’ Van Leeuwen
προσπόλων (or πρὸς γονῶν) Πελασγίδων,
Blaydes προπατόρων or θυγατέρων Πελασγικῶν,
but none of these guesses is satisfactory.
It is perhaps possible that
προσγόνων meant ‘after-born,’ with the
preposition denoting the increase of the
race. Some support may be found in the
use of προσγενής by Niceph. ap. Walz
Rhet. Gr. I 498, 7 θηβαῖος ἦν Διόνυσος καὶ

Eustratius (on Arist. eth. 1. 11 p. 10136

Larisa as a Pelasgian name in various
localities see Hom. B 840 f. (Leaf), and

<p>The speaker appears to be Perseus,
although Wilamowitz (Isyllow p. 60 33)
attributes the words to a messenger; and
it seems that in his third throw he was
baulked by Elatus, so that his quoit flew
wide and wounded Acrisius. Elatus is
known as a leader of the Lapithae living
at Larisa, and as the father of the Argonaut
Polyphemus: Hygin. fab. 14.
Dotion, here mentioned as his country,
which according to Steph. was called
after his daughter Dotia, is the name
given to the eastern part of the Larisaean
plain. Wilamowitz (l.c.) argued that
Sophocles took the name Elatus and his
home Dotion directly from Hesiod (frs.

text stands; for there is no authority for
the interpretation given by L. and S.

Nauck suggests προσῇξεν, but this hardly
seems the right word. It is probable
that if we possessed the context there
would be no difficulty: the following
line may have been something like τύχη
παραστάς, χεῖρα τῷ βραχίονι. — δισκήματι
is used where we should expect the noinen
actionis, rather than a noun expressing
the result; but ’s ἐν δισκου βολῇ
is certainly not required. Cf. Track.</p>

<p>It has generally been thought that
something is wrong with the text, which
seems to give the opposite of the sense
required. Hence Gesner altered μηδέ to
χρὴ δέ, which Dindorf, Wagner and
others adopt, and Tyrwhitt substituted
ἐπαυχεῖν for ἐπαρκεῖν. Both are satisfactory
in point of meaning, — for the
latter we might compare Hom. χ 412
οὐχ ὁσίη κταμένοισιν ἐπ᾿ ἀνδράσιν εὐχετάασθαι;
but it does not seem likely that
χρή was corrupted to μη —, or that so
good a word as ἐπαρκεῖν arose by accident.
It is possible, as Ellendt and
Campbell contend, that the context
would have cleared up the obscurity;
but the words seem to be part of a
direct admonition, and experiment will
show that it is not easy satisfactorily to
fill the gap. For the general sentiment
implied in the text as it stands cf. Eur.
Phoen. 1320 τοῖς γὰρ θανοῦσι χρὴ τὸν οὐ
τεθνηκότα | τιμὰς διδόντα χθόνιον εὖ σέβειν
θεόν. The spirit of the precept is by no
means that of ‘doing unto others as we
would they should do unto us.’ It is
merely another particular application of
the maxim θνητὰ φρονεῖν χρή (see on fr.
590), which itself illustrates the Greek
devotion to moderation and self-restraint
μηδὲν ἄγαν). Similarly in El. 1171
θνητοῦ πέφυκας πατρός, Ἠλέκτρα, φρόνει,
| θνητὸς δ’ Ὁρέστης· ὥστε μὴ λίαν
στένε, i.e. don't forget the limitations
imposed upon humanity, which require
you to suffer, Orestes to die. Holzner
defended the text by quoting Eur. Hel.

<p>The restoration of this fragment is
a hopeless quest, unless a new edition of
Hesychius should yield fresh material.
At present, as Nauck says, ‘ita editur,
de codicis scriptura non constat.’
grammatical explanation λίαν is of no
assistance, being merely a stock gloss of
worthless character: see Suid. s. v. ὡς,
who quotes fr. 960 in illustration of the
same rendering. Similarly the schol. on
Ai. 39 τὸ ws avTi τίν aXyjOCbs. There is
no value in such random guesses as
F. W. Schmidt's ὠς τὸν τύραννον (or ὥς
σ’, ὦ τύραννε,) πᾶς ἴτης ἐρᾷ φυγεῖν, or
Blaydes's ὡς τὴν τυραννίδ᾿ εὔχεται πᾶς τις</p>
<p>The sense obtained by the vulg. ὡς Καὶ
τύραννον πᾶς ἐφίεται φυγεῖν and similar
attempts is unsatisfactory: as a general
statement it is untrue or incomplete, and
if particularized bears no relation to what
is known of the plot. My suggestion
implies that the words refer to the with-
drawal of Acrisius to Larisa: ‘before

<p>Craneia was a hill-fortress in the territory

by the same name (Bursian, Geogr. I

so that there may be a connexion with
the Corinthian Craneum, for which see

<p>ΛΗΜΝΙΑΙ</p>
<p>The arrival of the Argonauts at Lemnos was the first recorded
incident in their voyage. They found it occupied only
by women, under the rule of Hypsipyle, the daughter of Thoas.
The Lemnian women had neglected the worship of Aphrodite,
who in consequence made them offensive to their husbands, so that
they were abandoned in favour of Thracian concubines brought
over from the mainland. The wives in revenge massacred their
husbands and fathers,—all except Hypsipyle, who saved the life
of her father Thoas. When the Argonauts landed, they formed
alliances with the women; and Hypsipyle bore to Jason two sons,
Euneus (Hom. Η 468) and another known either as Nebrophonus</p>

<pb n="52"/>
<p>(Apollod.), Deipylus (Hygin.), or Thoas (A. Ρ. 3. 10). Such is
the brief narrative of Apollodorus (1. 114 f.), to which
(FNG III 303) adds nothing.</p>
<p>The title might suggest that the central motive of the play
was the notorious crime committed by the women: cf Aesch.
Cho. 629 κακῶν δὲ πρεσβεύεται τὸ Λάμνιον λόγῳ. But schol.
Apoll. Rhod. I. 769 shows that both the present play and the
Hyrsipyle of Aeschylus were concerned rather with the landing
of the Argonauts and its consequences: ὅτι δὲ ἐμίγησαν οἱ
Ἀργοναῦται ταῖς Λημνίαις, Ἡρόδωρος ἱστορεῖ ἐν τοῖς
(FHG II 38). Αἰσχύλος δὲ ἐν Ὑψιπύλῃ (p. 79 N.)
ἐν ὅπλοις φησὶν αὐτὰς ἐπελθούσας χειμαζομένοις ἀπείργειν, μέΧρι
λάβεῖν ὅρκον παρ᾿ αὐτῶν ἀπόβαντας μιγήσεσθαι αὐταῖς. Σοφοκλῆς
δὲ ἐν ταῖς Λημνίαις καὶ μάΧην ἰσχυρὰν αὐτοὺς συνάψαι
φησίν. The statement of Aeschylus that the women armed
themselves and opposed the landing of the Argonauts agrees
with Apoll. Rhod. I. 635 δήια τεύχεα δῦσαι ἐς αἰγιαλὸν προχέοντο. . . ἡ
δ᾿ ἄμα τῇσι Θοαντιὰς Ὑψιπύλεια | δῦν᾿ ἐνὶ τεύχεσι
πατρός. So the habits of the women are described: τῇσι δὲ
βουκόλιαί τε βοῶν χάλκειά τε δύνειν Ι τεύχεα, πυροφόρους
διατμήξασθαι ἀρούρας | ῥηίτερον πάσῃσιν Ἀθηναίης πέλεν ἔργων
(ib. 627 ff., with which we should probably compare fr. 387). The
storm attested for Aeschylus and the battle-scene of Sophocles
are described with his usual elaboration by Statius (Theb. 5.
376—397). But the most important source for the whole incident
is ApoUonius, who tones down the harsher features of
the story agreeably to the taste of the Alexandrian epoch (I.
609—909). The women appear in armour, but Aethalides is
sent to make terms, which are immediately granted. Then
Polyxo, the aged nurse of Hypsipyle, recommends that the
strangers be invited to settle in the island, in order that
the women may not lack protection in the days to come.
Iphino is ordered to ask Jason to enter the city. At his
interview with Hypsipyle, she conceals the murder of the men,
representing that they were expelled by the women and are
living in Thrace. Subsequently all the Argonauts were welcomed
within the walls, except Heracles, who remained by the
ship. After a delay of several days1, Heracles rebuked them
for their indolence; the Argonauts at once made ready for departure;
and Hypsipyle and Jason exchanged parting speeches,
mournfully acquiescing in the destiny which forced them to
separate. Hyginus (fab. 15) takes from ApoUonius the proposal
of Polyxo, and also mentions Iphinoe, who is described
<note type="footnote">1 The stay lasted two years according to Ovid (Her. 6 56), one year according to
Statius (Thet. 5. 460), and four months according to Valerius Flaccus (2. 367).</note>

as ctistos portae and announces to Hypsipyle the arrival of the
Argonauts. Welcker, who assumes that the last-mentioned
detail is taken from Sophocles, assigns frs. 385 and 386 to a
speech of Iphinoe, and thinks that fr. 389 refers to her watch.
He justly observes that there is nothing tragic in Apollonius’
account1, and seeks to avoid the consequent difficulty by emphasizing
the importance of the battle as the principal incident
of the play. This is hardly satisfactory; for the battle cannot
have been much more than a skirmish, even when we give full
weight to the scholiast's epithet. The chief interest of the
subject for Sophocles must have been the opportunity which
it offered for delineating the character of a woman confronted
with such exceptional difficulties. The climax of the action
must surely have been the departure of Jason—less easily
effected, we may surmise, than in Apollonius; and the play
may have ended with the selling of Hypsipyle into slavery
after the discovery that Thoas was still alive (Apollod. 3. 65).
In that case the unity of time would require that the landing
and the battle were merely referred to as events that had
happened ἔξω τοῦ δράματος.
An isolated reference in Stephanus (fr. 386) implies that a
revised edition of the play was published.</p>

Stephanus, who errs in confusing the 
Lemnian Chryse with Chrysa in the 
Troad (see on fr. 40), makes a further 
blunder in describing it as πόλις τοῦ 
Ἀπόλλωνος, a description probably in- the E. of Lemnos, and it has recently
for the other Chryse (Hesych. in 
p. 54 s.v. Λυκαῖον). Chryse was a small

was bitten by the serpent guarding the 
shrine of the nymph Chryse or, according 
to others, of the goddess Athena wor-

Thence he was conveyed to Lemnos and 
abandoned (ib. 270). Before the time of 
Pausanias (8. 33. 4) it had been over- 
whelmed by an inundation, and dis-
appeared beneath the sea. The date of
it sdestruction must have been subsequent
third Mithridatic war, since it is
alluded to, though not named, in Appan's
account of a sea-fight of Lucullus (App.
Mithr. 77). The Admiralty chart shows
an extensive sand-bank immediately to
been reported that ancient ruins have
been observed on the sea-bottom. — Acisland
cording to a tradition mentioned by
Philostr. iun. imag. 18. 2, the altar of
Chryse was erected by Jason on his
voyage to Colchis. This is confirmed
by Doriades (A. P. 15. 26, 5), who calls
Jason Χρύσας ἀΐτας. Whether Sophocles
introduced the name in that connexion
cannot be determined. — Blaydes conj.

ancestors of the Thessalian nobility, and
the famous battle is the echo of some
prehistoric resettlement of Thessaly.

<p>Even if this was a satyr-play, it is extremely
tremely unlikely that Sophocles would
have commenced a line with ταχὺ δ’
αὐτό, dividing the anapaest between two
distinct words (see Jebb on Ο. C. 1361);
and I am convinced that Meineke was
right in substituting τάχ᾿ αὐτό. The
following points should be noted: (1)
τάχα is very common in Sophocles with
a fut. in the sense of soon (see Ellendt
s.v.), but ταχύ, quickly, only occurs
Phil. 349. (2) τάχα is regularly employed
in conjunction with the phrase
αὐτὸ δείξει and its congeners: Ar. Lys.
375 τοὔργον τάχ᾿ αὐτὸ δείξει, Eur. Andr.
265 τὸ δ᾿ ἔργον αὐτὸ σημανεῖ τάχα, Ar.
Ran. 1261 δείξει δὴ τάχα, Plat. Critias
108 C τοῦτο οἷόν ἐστιν αὐτό σοι τάχα δηλώσει.
(3) τάχα is usually glossed by
ταχέως (Phot., Suid., Etym. Μ.); but,
while the distinction between τάχα and
ταχύ indicated above prevails generally in
classical Greek, ταχύ came to be used
in place of τόχα at a later date. The
intrusion of δ’ will not surprise those who
have observed the ways of copyists. —
αὐτὸ δείξει is the common phrase (Plat.
Theaet. 200 E, Hipp. mai. 288 b) for
which αὐτὸ σημανεῖ (Eur. Phoen. 623
Bacch. 976), αὐτὸ δηλώσει (Dem. 19. 157)
or αὐτὸ διδάξει (Plat. Prot. 324 a) may
be substituted. Sometimes we find the
noun added, as here and in other passages
already quoted (cf. Dem. 19. 167); sometimes
the verb stands impersonally (Ar.
Fesp. 994, Pan. 1261, Plat. Phileb. 20 C,
rep. 497 C). — The latter part of the line
is almost certainly corrupt, as is generally
admitted. I have suggested οἶδ᾿
ἐγὼ σαφῶς, relying on the parenthetic
use of οἶδ᾿ ἐγώ in warnings of a similar
character: Ο. C. 852 χόνῳ γάρ, οἶδ᾿ ἐγώ,
γνώσῃ τάδε, id. 1197 οἶδ᾿ ἐγώ, τνώσῆ
κακοῦ | θυμοῦ τελευτὴν ὡς κακὴ προσγίγνεται.
Previous conjectures may be
divided into two classes: (1) those which
alter σαφῶς:—ὡς ἐγὼ σαφής Hense; ὦι
ἐγὼ σοφός Boissonade; (2) those which
alter ἐγώ:—ὡς λέγω, σαφῶς Burges; ὡς
ἔχει, ασθῶς Herwerden; ὡς ἔχω, σαφῶς
Wecklein; ὡς δοκῶ, σαφῶς Meineke.
Hense was justified in observing that the
examples of αὐτὸ δείξει show that it
should not be joined with σαφῶς.</p>

<p>ΜΑΝΤΕΙΣ Η ΠΟΛΥΙΔΟΣ</p>
<p>The story of Folyidus and Glaucus is related most fully by
Hyginus (fad. 136) and Apollodorus (3. 17—20)</p>
<p>Glaucus, son of Minos and Pasiphae, when a child, fell into
a large vessel full of honey, and perished.1. Minos did not know
what had become of him, and consulted the oracle of Apollo (or,
according to Apollodorus, the Curetes). The response was as
follows2. Minos had in his herds a wondrous cow, a prodigy
which changed its colour thrice a day, being in turn white, red,
and black. Whoever, said the oracle, could find the most
appropriate object of comparison to the marvel, would also be
able to give back the child alive to his father.</p>
<p>The soothsayers of Crete were called together, but failed to
solve the puzzle. Then a foreign diviner from Argos, Polyidus
son of Coeranus, successfully accomplished the task by comparing
the cow to a mulberry, white in the bud, then red, and
finally black.</p>
<p>Polyidus was then required by Minos to find Glaucus. The
seer had recourse to augury, and at last discovered the dead
child I But, when he brought the body to Minos, the latter demanded
that Polyidus should restore Glaucus to life. As the
seer declared this to be impossible, Minos resolved to bury him
alive in the same tomb with the corpse of the boy. Polyidus
was accordingly entombed; but in the vault itself he found
a way of deliverance. A snake came to the dead body, and
Polyidus killed it with a stone4. Presently he saw another snake
come, and cover the dead snake with a particular grass. Then
the dead snake came to life. So Polyidus brought the same

grass to the dead child, and resuscitated him. Minos, informed
by a passer-by who heard sounds in the tomb, caused it to be
opened, and having his son restored to him, sent back Polyidus,
with many rewards, to Argos. Apollodorus adds that even so
Minos would not allow Polyidus to depart until he had imparted
the secret of his craft to Glaucus. Polyidus consented, but at the
moment of his departure caused Glaucus to spit into his mouth;
the result was that by so doing he forgot the art of divination
which he had recently acquired1.</p>
<p>The main features of the story are summarized with a
rationalistic explanation by Palaephat. 27. From this legend
arose the proverb Γλαῦκος πιὼν μέλι ἀνέστη recorded by Apostol.
5.48.</p>
<p>No doubt Phamenus mentioned in fr. 392 was one of the
prophets who failed where Polyidus succeeded. Fr. 394 perhaps
refers to their attempts to identify the portent by divination δι᾿
ἐμπύρων, just as fr. 396 seems to refer to the augury of Polyidus.</p>
<p>It will be shown in the notes that Welcker was hardly right in
interpreting fr. 393 of the restoration of Glaucus to life, or fr.
399 of his corpse as bringing a curse on Polyidus. He also regards
fr. 398 as coming from a messenger's speech describing a
sacrifice made when Polyidus and Glaucus were entombed. But
the details of the sacrifice do not suit a funeral rite: they are
rather of a joyful, if primitive, character. It is more likely that
the reference is to a festival, on the occasion of which Glaucus
accidentally lost his life.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out in regard to the title of the play
that there are seven references to a play entitled Μάντεις,
three to a Polyidus. Frs. 390 and 391 prove that Polyidus was
mentioned more than once in the Μάντεις, Fr. 395, first attributed
to this play by Bergk, shows that Sophocles treated the
story of Glaucus. It is a natural, if not an inevitable deduction
from these premisses that the play of Sophocles bore the alternative
titles Μάντεις ἢ Πολύιδος. The chorus then consisted of
μάντεις,—assistants of Polyidus, or perhaps Curetes, as Welcker
thought.</p>
<p>The Κρῆσσαι of Aeschylus dealt with the same subject: see

fragments survive, including the famous fr. 638, see Nauck

N 663 ἦν δέ τις Εὐχήνωρ Πολυίδου
μάντιος υἱός) is deduced by Wackernagel
from πολύƑιδƑος, which would
be shortened in Attic: cf, φθίνω (= φθινƑω).
The form Πολύειδος, which shows itacistic
confusion, is entirely late. See Smyth,
Ionic Dialect, p. 187, and Α. J. Ρ. VI
440, who however does not accept
Wackernagel’s argument. Fick in

In Pind. Ol. 13. 75 Polyidus is described
by the patronymic Κοιρανίδας. The
father’s name perhaps indicates the association
of Polyidus with Crete; for
Coeranus is a Cretan in Hom. P 611.

The testimony of the grammarian

good for Ionic and old Attic, but in
regard to Attic generally there is less
agreement. Cobet, V. L. p. 159, rejected
κλείω and its derivatives everywhere
in Attic; but κέκλειμαι still appears
in the best texts of the Orators (Dem.
2. 16, 19. 315, Isocr. 4. 34, 6. 40).
Before Euclides, there was no distinction
of symbols, but Meisteihans quotes κλειομένην
from an inscription of 347 B.C.
(3p. 36 195). There can be no doubt that
κλᾐω is tragic, but that it should everywhere
be restored to Aristophanes (apart
from any question of paratragoedia) does
not appear to be so certain as is sometimes
assumed (Blaydes on Lys. 423).
κέκλεισμαι κέκλῃσμαι), which some editors
print in Ar. Vesp. 198, has very little
claim to consideration: see Rutherford,
New Phrynichus, p. 206, and for Ionic

Κρῆσσαι related to the same subject. It

ᾄδονταί γε ἐπὶ ταύτῃ τῇ σοφίᾳ Τειρεσίαι τε
καὶ Πολυδάμαντες Καὶ Πολύειδοι καὶ
καὶ ἄλλοι πολλοί. Euripides (fr.
636) made him infer that the corpse was
on dry land by observing the flight of
a sea-eagle, and discovering an owl steper
cellam vinariam sedenteni atque apes fugantem
(Hygin. fab. 136),—ἀβασανίστως,
says Ael. nat. an. 5. 2, who rebukes
Euripides for giving this account, because
there are no owls in Crete, The owl
γλαῦξ) no doubt pointed to Glaucus. Cf.
Claudian. bell. Get. 443 (quoted by
Welcker) Cretaque, si verax narratur

prodire seplcro, | queni senior vates
avium clangore repertum | gramine
restituit; mirae nam munere sortis | dulcia
mella necem, vitam dedit
anguis. Perhaps we may infer from
’s remark that Sophocles did not
mention the owl.</p>
<p>Küster (on Suid.) justly remarked that
the sense of the words is obscure; and
there is no direct authority for ’s
rendering voraces in pastu. Still γλαμυρούς
can hardly mean ‘blear eyed,’
and Hartung’s ‘rothäugigen Vögel
Futter’ is unintelligible. γλαμυρός is
a rare word, which might be synonymous
with γλάμων, as is shown by
the proverb in schol. Hom. Ω 192 ἐν
τυφλῶν πόλεϊ γλαμυρὸς βασιλεύει. Hence
Hesych. I p. 432 γλαμυρόν· γλαμῶδες.
ἔνυγρον. ὑπόδακρυν, which is plainly akin
to ktym. M. p. 232, 44 γλαμυρὸν καί
γλαμῶδες· ὑγρὸν καὶ καιόμενον τηκόμενον
Toup) δακρύοις ἄμμα· καὶ
ἐνυγροβίους. The last words have the
appearance of being a gloss on our
passage, and suggest that Sophocles
was speaking of aquatic birds. But
even if the reference was intended, it
would be hazardous to accept the interpretation
For it is much more likely,
as Lobeck thought (Path. El. I p. 93),
that γλαμυρός was a by-form of λαμυρός
and was used by Sophocles in the sense
of greedy. The scholiast connected it
with γλάμων, because that word is related
to λημᾶν in a similar way. Moeris
p. 193 30 γλαμῶσα Ἀττικός,
λοινὸν ἀμφότερα. (Blaydes should not
have proposed to substitute λαμυρούς.)
Probably however we should go further
and infer from the association with
ἀκάθαρτος that greediness connoted uncleanness
of feeding in the ceremonial
sense. The order in Suid. Zonar. favours
this view; but it is quite tenable, even if
schol. Ar. preserves the original form of
the note. Some birds, and this would
apply particularly to the ὠμοφάγοι (Arist.
h. a. 9. 1), were presumably
Such was the vulture in all circumstances:
Anton. Lib. 21 γῦπα πάντων ὁρνίθων
ἔχθιστον θεοῖς τε Καὶ ἀνθρώποις. But
the feeding of other birds might require
for its interpretation the discriminating
intelligence of the expert: Aesch. Prom.
504 γαμψωνύχων τε πτῆσιν οἰωνῶν σκεθρῶς
| διώρισ᾿. . . καὶ δίαιταν ἥντινα ἔχουσ᾿
ἕκαστοι. No better illustration of the
omens to be gathered from the habits of
the birds of prey is required than the
well-known passage in the Agamemnon
describing the eagles feasting on the
pregnant hare: οἴκτῳ γὰρ ἐπίφθονος
Ἄρτεμις ἁγνὰ | πτανοῖσιν Κυσὶ πατρὸς |

combination οὔτοι γ᾿ is open to serious
objection: see Neil on Ar. Eq. p. 194.
This is avoided by Cobet's οὐδέποτ᾿
ἐφίξει, which however departs too far
from the tradition. Bamberger's οὔτοι
καθίξει would imply ‘striking from above,’
and Reisig's οὔτοι ποθ᾿ ἔξει gives a wrong
sense (see Jebb on Ο.Τ. 891). Meineke

that the simple verb might be used for

(C.R. XVI 434); but he subsequently
hesitated between this and ’πιθίξει on the
ground that Sophocles did not carry
through his figures consistently. Similarly
Tucker had suggested τι θίξῃ, but
the use of τι is questionable οὐδέποτε

would be προσίξῃ, which I should not
hesitate to adopt if the authority for
προσικνεῖσθαι c. gen. were stronger than
it is: the construction is defended by
Verrall and Tucker in Aesch. Cho. 1031
but the legitimacy of the compound requires
more support before it can be
considered as established. Mekler conjectured
’πιτεύξει.</p>

<p>We are not informed as to the occasion

πρὸ τοῦ σπηλαίου, θέντες δὲ καταχέουσιν
αὐτῶν ἔλαιον. The sacrifice is
clearly one of the primitive bloodless
type, an offering of first-fruits to induce
a continuance of fertility. That it is
also fireless ἄπυρος) is not directly stated,
but is made probable by Eur. fr. 904
θυσίαν ἄπυρον παγκαρπείας δέξαι πλήρη
προχυθεῖσαν, and by the analogy of the
εἰρεσιώνη. H. inferred that the
was chthonic (C. R. XVI 545). For the
significance of the ἄπυρα see his n. on
Ag. 70, Miss Harrison, Proleg. p. 93 ff.,
Farnell in C. R. XI 294. Wilamowitz
(de tr. Gr. fragm. p. 17) assumes that
the sacrifice was offered by Minos, and
connects it with the asceticism of the
Cretan mystics (Eur. fr. 472). kappelmacher
( Wiener Erattos, p. 36 goes
further and refers to the sacrifice of Minos
offered to the Charites (Apollod. 3. 210).
But no particular inference appears to be
justifiable. Wool is generally mentioned
as forming part of the offering, and in
the more primitive ritual unwashed wool

<pb n="63"/>
is specified: thus either prepared or in
its natural state it appears in the worship
of Zeus κτήσιος (Athen. 473 c), in the
ceremony known as κερνοφορία (Athen.</p>
<p>478 D), and even in the invocation of the
Eumenides (O. C. 475). In El. 635
θύματα πάγκαρπα are a propitiatory
offering to Apollo as averter of evil.</p>

<p>2 σπονδή: a libation of wine, as distinguished
from a drink-offering, together
with an offering of grapes, appears to be
contemplated. Miss Harrison formerly

as a later addition to the simple
ritual of antiquity, but now treats the
whole oblation as a magical rite intended
to stimulate the reproductive action of
nature (Themis, p. 294).</p>

supposes that it is the corpse of Glaucus
which is described as bringing a curse
upon Polyidus; Hartung that the speaker

to a chance meeting with a corpse. But
neither view satisfies ὁ πρόσθεν ἐλθών;
and it is more likely that these words
refer to the first of the two snakes which
entered the vault while Polyidus was
imprisoned there, and was slain by him
to prevent it from harming the body of
Glaucus: see Introductory Note. It may
be thought questionable whether the
corpse of an animal would be described
as ἀραῖος. Frazer, however, has collected
copious stores of evidence in support of
the general proposition that ‘the primitive
hunter who slays an animal believes
himself exposed to the vengeance either
of its disembodied spirit or of all the
other animals of the same species, whom
he considers as knit together, like men,
by the ties of kin and the obligations of
the blood feud, and therefore as bound
to resent the injury done to one of their

<p>ΜΕΛΕΑΓΡΟΣ</p>
<p>The Homeric version of the legend of Meleager is as follows1.
Artemis was wroth with Oeneus for omitting to sacrifice to her,
when he made thank-offering to the other gods; and sent a wild
boar to ravage his crops. Meleager, the son of Oeneus, collected
a large company of hunters, and with their assistance killed the
boar, but only after several lives had been lost. Artemis then
provoked a dispute between the Aetolians of Calydon and the
Curetes of Pleuron for the possession of the head and skin.
A fight ensued, in which, so long as Meleager kept the field,
the assaults of the Curetes were driven back. But Althaea, the
mother of Meleager, grieving for the death of her brother2, cursed
her son, and prayed to the powers of the nether world that he
might be destroyed. Meleager was incensed and withdrew from
the war. Then the Curetes got the upper hand, and pressed hard
upon the defenders of Calydon. The elders sent an embassy
of priests, promising Meleager a rich grant of land if he would
come out and fight; and his father Oeneus, his sisters, and his
mother also appealed to him, but in vain. At last, when the
missiles of the foe reached his own chamber, and his wife
Cleopatra reminded him of the sufferings likely to fall upon
the inhabitants of a captured city, he yielded to her entreaties,
and saved the Aetolians from their impending doom. It is not
directly stated by Homer that Meleager was killed in battle;
but his subsequent fate is clearly implied in the statement that
<note type="footnote">1 Hom. I 529—599.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 Only one brother is mentioned. It is assumed that he was killed by Meleager
in the fight, altho’ this is not directly stated.</note>

<pb n="65"/>
the implacable Erinys hearkened to Althaea’s curse.1 The epics
known as the Eoeae (EGF p. 142) and the Minyas (EGF p. 216)
agreed in the assertion that Meleager was killed by Apollo, who
assisted the Curetes against the Aetolians. There is thus no
evidence that the fire-brand upon the preservation of which
’s life depended was mentioned in any of the epics.
But the absence of direct evidence is by no means conclusive;
the story is too primitive to have been merely a literary invention2.
Moreover, although the legend of the fire-brand was
familiar to the dramatists and owed a still wider extension to
their writings, Pausanias (10. 31. 4), when quoting the Pleuroniae
of Phrynichus (TGF p. 721) as containing the earliest allusion
to it which is found in a play3, adds that he did not introduce it
as if it were his own invention, but rather as though it was
already notorious throughout the Greek world. The version
of Bacchylides (5. 95—150) is of importance as showing that
the death of Meleager in battle was not necessarily inconsistent
with the story that he expired as soon as the brand was consumed
in the fire4.</p>
<p>So far we find no reference to Atalanta. But th prevalent
form 5 of the story relates that Meleager, who had invited Atalanta
to take part in the hunt, fell in love with her, and insisted
on presenting her with the hide of the Calydonian boar. The
sons of Thestius were indignant that a woman should receive
the trophy, and took it from her. Meleager slew them in wrath,
and restored the boar-skin. Then Althaea kindled the firebrand,
and Meleager died. It is generally believed6 that the
prominence of the love-motive in the later authorities is largely
due to the influence of Euripides, in whose Meleager (TGF
p. 525) Atalanta undoubtedly took a leading part.</p>
<p>It becomes important to observe that Apollodorus, after
giving the last-mentioned version, which probably goes back
to Euripides, adds another7 as current in different authorities.
This consists mainly of an abstract of the Homeric story, with
the addition of the name of Iphiclus as that of one of the sons
of Thestius, and of a statement that Meleager was killed in
battle. There is also a supplement to the effect that, after the

death of Meleager, Althaea and Cleopatra hanged themselves,
and the women who mourned over his corpse were transformed
into birds. Here we meet with an incident which is known to
have been mentioned by Sophocles: Plin. nat. hist. 37. 11. 40
Sophocles tragicus poeta... ultra Indium fieri dixit (sc. electrum) e
lacrimis meleagridum avium Meleagrum deflentium. quod et
credidisse eum vel sperasse aliis persuaderi posse quis non miretur?
quamue pueritiam tam imperitam posse reperiri, quae avium ploratus
annuos credat locrimasve tam grandes, avesque e Graecia, ubi
Meleager periit, ploratum isse in Indos? (They were looking for
the tomb of Meleager: ib. 10. 26. 74) These μελεαγρίδες (guineafowl)
are frequently referred to, and are generally located in the
island of Leros (Aelian nat. an. 4. 42, 5. 27, Athen. 655 B), but
also in Africa (Mnaseas fr. 41, FHG III 156). Strabo 215
transfers them to the Eridanus, evidently confusing them with
the Heliades. They were also kept as sacred fowl on the
Acropolis (Phot, Suid.)1</p>
<p>It has been inferred2 that the plot of Sophocles is to be
found in the second extract of Apollodorus, and that his play
approximated to the Homeric story. There is another piece
of evidence which points the same way: schol. A Hom. l 575
ἐντεῦθεν Σοφοκλῆς ἐν τῷ Μελεάγρῳ τὸν χορὸν ἀπὸ ἱερέων παρήγαγεν.
The agreement with Homer was hardly accidental, and
it seems legitimate to conclude from it that the siege of Calydon
by the Curetes was a leading feature in the development of the
plot3. If so, although Atalanta may have been mentioned as
taking part in the hunt, as Brunck inferred from fr. 1111, her
share in the plot can only have been of minor importance.
Anyhow it is extremely unlikely that Euripides was the first
writer who connected Atalanta with the Calydonian hunt4.
Aeschylus wrote an Atalanta, but nothing is known about its
contents.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 R. Holland (in Roscher 11 2588) thinks that the transference of the μελεαγρίς
mythology was the invention of Sophocles. He supposes that the domestic fowl was
called μελέαγρος (Hesych. s.v. ἡ κατοικίδιος ὄρνις) from μελεάζειν,—a cant term like
κοκκυβόας. The guinea-fowl received the same name, when first becoming known
at Athens, from its resemblance to the barn-door chicken. All this is somewhat
fanciful.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 So Preller, Gr. Myth, ΙΙ3 205, followed by Ribbeck, Röm. Trag. p. 506, who
supposes that Meleager was reconciled with his mother, but too late. So also Kekulé,
as reported by Kuhnert in Roscher II 2596.</note>
<note type="footnote">3 This conclusion agrees with the observation made by Ahrens that the reference
to the wild boar in fr. 401 implies that the hunt had taken place some time before the
inception of the dramatic action.</note>

represented by the adj. monstrous, is
elsewhere applied to a wild boar: Herod.

—α passage which so closely resembles the
text of Sophocles that it may be regarded
as another instance of the connexion
between these two writers. H. quotes
schol. Hom. χ 9, telling the story of
Ancaeus the Samian, son of Poseidon,
who was killed by a boar which was
ravaging his land: ἄφνω συνέβη χρῆμα
συὸς μεγάλου ἐπιζαρῆσαι τοῖς Ἀγκαίου

colloquial, is well illustrated by Blaydes
on Ar. Lys. 1031 and Starkie on Vesp. 933.
See also on Eur. Phoen. 198.—γύαις was
corrected by Cobet to Υύας, but the dative
may well be right as involving the idea
of hostility, ‘against’: cf. Eur. Phoen,
1129 Καπανεὺς προσῆγε λόχον ἐπ᾿ Ἠλέκτραις

express motion towards was obsolete in
the fifth century, though here and there
examples may be found like Aesch. Theb.

The form ὀπισάμβων given by Vat.
Bodl. was rightly rejected by
before the publication of the Athoan
text. There is no sufficient ground to
displace the tradition that the word was
connected with ἀναβαίων, but it is not
clear how it is related, if at all, to ἄμβων
(Aesch. fr. 103) or ἄμβη: see Etym. Μ.
p. 81, 7. Analogy must have played
a considerable part in the history of
σαλάμβη (fr. 1093), κακάμβη, λαμβά,
χηράμβη and other obscure words with
a similar termination. If we concede
the verbal origin, the best parallel, so
far as concerns formation, is perhaps
ἐμβλώ in Hesych. 11 p. 73. This is derived
by Hesych. from ἐμβλέπειν and
compared with the fem. hypocoristics
Δωρώ and Δεξώ, but by Lobeck (Path.
Prol. p. 3536) from ἐμβάλλω after ἔμβαλε

κύλλῃ. He compares πρόσθη, ἐπιβλή,
κάβλη, ἐπίκλη, ὁμοκλή, ἐπιπλή, some of
which are as doubtful as their accents.
As regards meaning, the hypocoristic ώ
forms such as daXXib or κοσμώ are closely
allied with nouns of agency, as Lobeck
has shown (Aglaoph. p. 733), quoting
γλιχώ, θελκτώ, and others. There is
some evidence, collected by Lobeck, that
the termination was peculiarly Doric:
Hesych. ΙΙ p. 485 κινώ· κίνησις. Δωριεῖς.

called Σιτώ by the Syracusans. But,
whatever may have been its literary
flavour, ὀπισαμβώ was doubtless less
uncouth to Soph, than it seems to us;
and we may conclude that its appearance
in tragedy is as well justified as that of
μελλώ (Aesch. Ag. 1355) or δοκώ (Eur.

<p>ἄβολος is the name given to a horse
before he has shed his teeth, i.e.
to Aristotle (hist. an. 6. 22. 576a 11) up
to the age of Plato years. Plato distinguishes
three ages πώλοις τε ἀβόλοις Καὶ τελείων 
τε Καὶ ἀβόλων τοῖς μέσοις καὶ αὐτοῖς δὴ 
τέλος ἔχουσι (legg. 834 c). The best
authority is Arist. l.c., 576b 13 ἀκμάζει
δὲ καὶ ἵππος καἰ ἡνίονος μετὰ τοὺς βόλους·

μην γνῶμα al.) ἔχειν, ὅταν ἄβολος ᾖ·
ὅταν δὲ βεβληκώς, οὐΚ ἔχειν. The last
sentence clearly alludes to a popular
witticism. Bekk. anecd. p. 322,2 ἄβολος·
οὐδέπω ἔχων τι ἐπὶ τῶν ὀδόντων γνώρισμα
seems to be inconsistent with Aristotle,
and is perhaps due to a confusion between
according acquiring and casting the γνώμονες, the
fourth set of teeth which an ass drops
(Arist. 6. 23. 577a 21): see also Suid.,
Hesych., schol. Plat., Eustath. Od.

milk teeth was known as κατηρυκώς:

<p>ΜΥΣΟΙ</p>
<p>The title is recorded in the inscription already referred to in
connexion with the Μοῦσαι (CIA II 992 I 24).</p>
<p>It is generally admitted that this play was concerned with
the fortunes of Telephus after his arrival in Mysia (see Introductory
Note to the Aieadae, I p. 48); and the subject of the
plot was traced by Welcker to Hygin. fab. 100. King Teuthras
was threatened by Idas, who cannot have been the Apharid as
Hyginus states, but was probably a local freebooter from Mt Ida
(Thraemer, Pergamos, p. 376), at the time when Telephus arrived
in Mysia with his friend Parthenopaeus1. Hyginus states that
Telephus came in search of his mother, following the command
of the oracle, and this agrees with other authorities quoted on
I p. 47, to which may be added Suid. s.v. ἔσχατος Μυσῶν πλεῖν
...ἔνιοι τὴν παροιμίαν τοὐ χρησμοῦ λέγουσι Τηλέφῳ
γεγονέναι περὶ γονέων, ἐπὶ τίνας τόπους ἐλθὼν εὕπροι τοὺς γονεῖς.
<note type="footnote">1 The two names were no doubt connected because both were reared amongst the
hills of Arcadia, Telephus on Mt Parthenius, Parthenopaeus on Mt Maenalus (Eur.
Phoen. 1162 n.). Thraemer argues that Soph, would not have confused independent
legends.</note>

δ᾿ εἰς Τευθρανίαν, νέμεσθαι γὰρ ταῦτα τὰ χωρία Μυσούς, ἐπιτυχεῖν
τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ (= schol. [Eur.] Rhes. 248). It is not certain,
however, that this was the account of Sophocles; for we have
seen, in dealing with the Aleadae (p. 48), that Telephus had
incurred blood-guiltiness by killing his uncles, and his exile
may have been enjoined for the purpose of expiation ἀπενιαυτισμός)1.
We hear of the consequent taboo laid upon Telephus
in Arist. poet. 24. 1460 a 32 ἐν Μυσοῖς ὁ ἄφωνος ἐκ Τεγέας εἰς
τὴν Μυσίαν ἥκων, which is generally referred to the Mysians of
Aeschylus (TGF p. 47); and the disability is connected with his
homicide by Amphis fr. 30 (ll 244 K.) ἔκυψεν ὥσπερ Τήλεθος |
πρῶτον σιωπῇ καὶ δικαίως τοῦτό γε· | ἅπαντες ἀνδροφόνοι γάρ
εἰσιν ἐνὶ λόγῳ). However this may be, the Sophoclean Telephus
does not seem to have been under a ban of silence on his arrival:
see fr. 411. Teuthras offered the succession to the throne
and the hand of his adopted daughter Auge to the conqueror
of Idas, and she was accordingly betrothed to Telephus, who
with the assistance of Parthenopaeus successfully accomplished
the adventure. But Auge, who was faithful to the memory of
Heracles, prepared to slay her spouse on the wedding-night, and
for that purpose concealed a sword in her bedchamber. Her
intention was frustrated by a miracle: for a huge serpent issued
from the ground to protect Telephus, so that Auge threw down
her sword and confessed her treachery. Telephus was about to
exact vengeance upon her, when she called upon Heracles, as
the betrayer of her maidenhood. An explanation ensued; and
Telephus recognized his mother and returned with her to Tegea.

a tragic source is proved by Aelian nat. Πη. 3. 47 δότε μοι τοὺς

Sophocles. Further, Robert holds1 that a series of events in
the life of Telephus which comprise the plot of the present
play is represented on the fragments of the smaller frieze of
the Pergamene altar. Fr. 411 clearly relates to the arrival in
Mysia, and Robert plausibly refers frs. 412 and 413 to a feast
held in honour of the betrothal of Telephus and Auge. Arguing
from Aelian that the tragic plot abstracted by Hyginus was
known in the imperial age,—at a date when the works of the
lesser tragedians had perished,—he concluded that the play,
since it cannot have been the work of Euripides, must have
been written either by Aeschylus or Sophocles. If Robert’s
premisses are accepted, we can hardly hesitate to prefer the
claim of Sophocles; but when he proceeds to compare the plots
of the Cresphontes and the Ion, and to infer that the Mysi must
be later than the former (B.C. 427), because the recognition-scene
takes place in the θάλαμος his reasoning fails to convince. Still
less can we follow Pilling (de Telephi fabula, diss. Hal. 1886
p. 63), who holds that the story in Hyginus is copied from the
Iphigenia in Tatiris of Euripides, and belongs therefore to a play
subsequently produced.</p>
<p>Thraemer (Pergamos, p. 374 ff.) thought that Hyginus cannot
derive from Sophocles, since Telephus had only to proclaim his
errand in order at once to ensure recognition. The objection
has been partly met by anticipation, and the absurdity of the
situation is in any case no greater than in the Oedipus Tyranmis,
where it has been successfully overcome. When Thraemer
urges further that Sophocles followed the common version of
ApoUodorus (3. 103 f) and Diodorus (4. 33), he omits to add
that these writers record nothing concerning the recognition
which could serve as a basis for dramatic treatment.

much too strongly. It is true that κἄν
would be defensible, if it were the traditional

used in a limiting sense without a verb

<p>The traditional text is not quite clear,
and Tucker had some reason for suggesting
the addition of κακῶς after ἔχων. The
absence of context necessarily leaves
a doubt, but on the assumption that
μόχθους, πόνους or the like might have
been supplied as the object to ἔχων—
a construction for which see Jebb on
Track. 260 ΕΙ. 962—the adverb might
stand in place of an adjective such as
ἐλαχίστους in accordance with a wellknown
idiom: cf. Thuc. 6. 27 τὸ πρᾶγμα
μειζόνως ἐλάμβανον, Dem. 20. 22 τοὺς ἅπαντας
ἀπίστως πρὸς ἠμᾶς αὐτοὺς διαθῶμεν.
Ellendt is inaccurate in treating ἥκιστα
as an adjective and equating it with τὰ
ἐλάχιστα.</p>
<p>For the general sense, which recalls
the pessimism of O.C. 1225, cf. Herond.

i.e. three bacchiacs (cf. Aesch. Ag. 1069

is unusual and, if the text is sound,
almost certainly incomplete.

’The land of the Mysians is called
Mysia.’ It would be hypercritical
require ’ The land belongs to the Mysians
and is called Mysia,’ though the
might be attained by putting a comma
after Μυσῶν. Ellendt, relying on Ο. T.
1437 θνητῶν φανοῦμαι μηδενὸς προσήγορος,
thinks it ‘more elegant’ to render
called Mysian by the Mysians.’ But
sense yielded is inferior. Dindorf reads
Μυσίᾳ, on the analogy, I suppose, of
ὀνόματί τινα προσαγορεύειν: but the vulgate
is just as good Greek.—προσήγορος
is passive also in Phil. 1353 τῷ προσήγορος;
‘who will speak to me?’
is no difficulty in its application to a place
rather than to a person: cf. e.g. Plat.

the Μυσοί is repeated at 635 c.</p>
<p>1 f. We must suppose that the verb
governed by τρίγωνος occurred in a previous
line together with another subject
to which τp. is linked by δέ. Nauck is
alone in retaining συγχορδίᾳ; for the
nominative is clearly preferable. J. renders:
‘And many a Phrygian harp...,
and zn response to it (adv.) resounds the
harmony συγχορδία for συγχορδίᾳ) of the
Lydian lyre.’ But it may be doubted
whether this is the true meaning of
ἀντίσπαστα. It should be observed that
this passage and Phrynichus fr. 11 (v.
infra) are adduced in support of the
interpretation given by Aristoxenus to
a particular passage of Pindar. And it
seems clear that it was Aristoxenus himself
who quoted the use of ἀντίσπαστος
by Phrynichus and Sophocles as identical
with that of ἀντίφθογγος in Pind. fr. 125
τόν ῥα Τέρπανδρός ποθ᾿ ὁ Λέσβιος εὗρε |
πρῶτος ἐν δείπνοισι Λυδῶν | ψαλμὸν ἀντίφθογγον
ὑψηλᾶς ἀκούων πηκτίδος This
refers explicitly to the πηκτίς, but Aristoxenus
treated πηκτίς and μάγαδις
identical for the purpose he had in view
(cf. 635 E), and both of them
to the class of πολύχορδα. Thus we can
explain what in any other view of their
interpretation is unintelligible, why three
quotations relating to the πηκτίς are
inserted in the middle of a discussion
concerning the nature of the μάγαδις.
Aristoxenus explained ψαλμὸν ἀντίψθογγον
thus: διὰ τὸ διὰ δύο γενῶν ἅμα
διὰ πασῶν ἔχειν τὴν συνῳδίαν ἀνδρῶν τε
Καὶ πάίδων. That is to say, the πηκτίς
(or μάγαδις) had two sets of strings in
different octaves, so that it could be used
to accompany the antiphonal singing of
men and boys. Similarly here ἀντίσπαστα
means ‘doubly-twanged (notes)’; and it
follows that the πηκτίς required to be
played with both hands. Notice how
συγχορδία gains in significance. The
double set of strings must also be indicated
by the epithet δίχορδος attributed
to the πηκτίς by Sopater ap. Athen.
183 B; for it is incredible that the πηκτίς
πολύχορδος) had only two strings. It is
fair to admit that there were others—
followed apparently by all modern editors
—who gave the meaning ‘responsive’ to
ἀντίφθογγον in Pindar (Athen. 635 D);
but these were at any rate later than
Posidonius, and their authority cannot
reasonably be set against that of Aristo-
xenus.</p>
<p>τρίγωνος, ‘a triangular harp, associated
with the πηκτίς (see on fr. 241).’
Plato banishes both instruments from hiscommonwealth:
rep. 399 C τριγώνων ἄρα
καὶ πηκτίδων Καὶ πάντων ὀργάνων, ὅσα
πολύχορδα καὶ πολυαρμόνια, δημιουργοὺς
οὐ θρέψομεν. There is an excellent account
of both in Susemihl and Hicks,
Politics of Aristotle, I p. 632 f. and p. 635
from which I quote: ‘Practically all the
ancients, agreeing with Aristotle, were
of opinion that the τρίγωνον, and more
especially the σαμβύκη [another triangular
instrument], were only suitable for loose
songs and melodies and persons of light
character.’ —ἀντίσπαστα, taken as
by J., might equally well be the
object of ἐφυμνεῖ (fr. 90); and this
perhaps more in accordance with the
usage of the verb. J. quotes Phrynichus
fr. 11 ψαλμοῖσιν ἀντίσπαστ᾿ ἀείδοντες μέλη,
—adding ‘ψαλμός is the touching of a
cithara's or a lyre's strings'—and Diogenes
fr. I. 9 ψαλμοῖς τριγώνων πηκτίδων ἀντιζύγοις
| ὁλκοῖς κρεκούσας μάγαδιν, i.e.
sounding the μάγαδις, a variety of the
πηκτίς, with twangings that answer to
the noise of τρίγωνοι and πηκτίδες. In the
last passage all three instruments are said
to be played by Lydian maidens.</p>

the present passage: σισυρνώδης στολὴ
(Nauck conj. σισυρνώδη στολήν)· τὸν ἐΚ
τῆς σισύρνης στολισμόν.</p>
<p>The words are intended to describe the
dress of an oriental grandee. On the
assumption that ψέλια is to be read, or
ψαλίδας interpreted in the same sense,
the appropriateness of the firs two words
is clear. The form of dress which the
Greeks regarded as a Persian characteristic
was originally Median, and was
subsequently adopted from them by the
Persians (Xen. Cyr. 1. 3. 2, 8. 3.
Gold armlets ψέλαι were worn as well
as collars στρεπτοί): see Hdt. 9 80
Xen. Cyr. 6. 4. 2.—The τιάρα or ‘turbab,’
also known as κυρβασία or κίδαρις, a
small skull-cup made of cotton, was the
national head-gear of Asiatics; the king
alone was entitled to wear τιάραν ὀρθήν,
i.e. stiffened so as to rise from the head
like the crown of a hat (Xen. anab. 2. 5.
23).—The relevance of σισυρνώδη στολήν
is less obvious, σίσυρνα is probably
dialectical (Ion. Aeol.) variant of σισύρα
(so Herwerden, Lex. Suppl. s.v.): for no
reliance can be placed on the distinction
drawn by Hesych. l.c. σίσυρνα μὲν γὰρ
χιτῶνος εἶδος· σισύρα δὲ διφθέρα εἰς ἀμπεχόνην
καὶ στρωμνὴν ἐπιτηδείως ἔχουσα
κτἑ. (This was probably an explanation
provided ad hoc. to suit the present passage:
still less can we place confidence in
the schol. recc. of Aristophanes, who
take another view.) σισύρα was a skin
coat worn as an outer wrap or by rustics
(cf. βαίτη), or used as a blanket. Such
a covering seems remote from the elegant
purple κάνδυς, for which see Holden on
Xen. Cyr. 1. 3. 2. But it was not so
much the material as the shape of the
Persian robe, completely enveloping its
wearer, which excited the wonder of the
Greeks. When made of a thick, woolly
material it was called καυνάκης: see
Pollux 7. 58, who also says that the
κάνδυς was sometimes made of skins.
The whole description in Ar. Vesp.
1132 ff. serves as a commentary on
σισυρνώδη στολήν. Philocleon is afraid
of being smothered in the thick overcoat
in which his son wishes to wrap him, and
asks what it is. (1137) ΒΔ. οἱ μὲν καλοῦσι
Περσίδ᾿ , οἱ δὲ καυνάκην. | ΦΙ. ἐγὼ δὲ
σισύραν ᾠόμην θυμαιτίδα. | ΒΔ. κοὐ
θαῦμά γ᾿. εἰς Σάρδεις γὰρ οὐΚ ἐλήλυθας
Telephus was as untravelled as Philocleon.
It seems therefore unnecessary to think
specifically of the military cloak known
as μανδύδας (Ael. Dion, fr. 252 Schw.
Hesych. III p. 70, Pollux 7. 60). The
σισυρνοφόροι of Hdt. 7. 67 are half-civilized
warriors from Afghanistan. Cf. generally
Themist. or. 2. p. 36 C τιάρα δὲ οὐ ποιεῖ
βελτίω οὐδὲ κάνδυς οὐδὲ μανδύας οὐδὲ
ἀκινάκης χρυσοῦς οὐδὲ στρεπτοί τε καὶ
ψέλια.</p>
<p>ψαλίδας (see cr. n.) is probably an
error: cf. fr. 367. Alternatively it means
a ‘pair of’ scissors,’ which is equally beside
the mark. Ellendt thinks that ψαλίς
may have been used with the meaning of
ψέλιον; but of this there is no evidence,
and the corruption assumed by the adoption
of Bergk's conjecture is simple
enough ΨΕΛΙΑ through ΨΑΛΛΙΑ to
Ψαλιδας). ψέλια is clearly right

<p>ἄπυρος, as an epithet of dvala, serves
to describe the bloodless offerings of
fruit, cereals, and liquids, as distinguished
from the sacrifice of an animal
victim, because the former were not as
a general rule consumed by burning
on the altar. See Farnell in C. R. XI
294 ff., who has established this meaning
for Aesch. Ag. 70, much in the same
way as it was afterwards independently
explained by Headlam. Cf. Eur. fr.
912, 4 dvaiav airvpov irayKapireias. The
Rhodian sacrifice was a famous instance:
Pind. Ol. τεῦξαν δ᾿ ἀπύροις ἱεροῖς |
ἄλσος ἐν ἀκροπόλι. See also fr. 398.
ἀπύρου here may have been the epithet
of some such word as πελάνου, and
though there are other possibilities (see
Farnell, p. 296, Stengel in Pauly-Wissowa
II 293) none is so likely as this.
The gloss ἀθύτου would then be referable
to the stricter sense of θύειν ‘to consume
with fire,’ for which see Miss Harrison,

<p>ΜΩΜΟΣ ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚΟΣ</p>
<p>The character of the fragments, apart from the direct evidence
of fr. 424, shows that the Μῶμος was a satyr-play. Welcker1
was certainly wrong in thinking that Κῶμος rather than Μῶμος
was the real title. Choeroboscus in Theod. p. 376, 18 confused
the play of Sophocles with one written by Achaeus (TGF p. 753)
under the same title.</p>
<p>Momus is mentioned in Hes. Theog. 214 as one of the
children of Night, but is scarcely referred to elsewhere in extant
Greek literature, until he appears as a character in the dialogues
of Lucian. The only trace of his active participation in the
events of the heroic saga is to be found in schol. A Hom. A 5
where the desire of Zeus to relieve the burden imposed upon
the earth by over-population is said to have been gratified in the
first instance by the Theban expedition, in which many lives
were lost: ὕστερον δὲ πάλιν συμβούλῳ τῷ Μώμῳ χρησάμενος
(scil. πολλοὺς ἀπώλεσεν), ἢν Διὸς βουλὴν Ὅμηρός φησιν, ἐπειδὴ
οἷός τε ἦν κεραυνοῖς ἢ κατακλυσμοῖς πάντας διαφθείρειν. ὅπερ
τοῦ Μώμου κωλύσαντος, ὑποθεμένου δὲ αὐτῷ τὴν Θέτιδος θνητογαμίαν
καὶ θυγατέρος καλῆς γένναν, ἐξ ὦν ἀμφοτέρων πόλεμος
Ἕλλησί τε καὶ βαρβάροις ἰγένετο κτἑ. The abstract of the
Cypria given by Proclus (EGF p. 17) is too brief to prove
that Momus is substituted by the scholiast for Themis2; but
whether he appeared in the epic narrative or not—and
the scholiast certainly implies that he did—the story of his
being taken into council is unquestionably old, and nothing
else is so likely to have been the subject of this play. In that
case, it was the first part of a trilogy—not of course in the
technical sense—of which the second and the third were the
Ἔρις and the Κρίσις (see I p. 139, II p. 29).</p>

<p>Wagner preferred to find the story of the play in the fable
related in Lucian Herinot. 20, according to which Momus found
fault with the model of Man made by Hephaestus, because there
were no windows in his chest to expose his inner feelings.</p>

<lg><l>ἀλώπηξ</l></lg>
<p>419 Hesych. I p. 136 ἀλώπηξ· ὄρχησίς
τις. Καὶ ἀλωπεκίαι μώμων, ὡς Σοφοκλῆς,
ὅπερ ἐστὶ ἐν σώματι πάθος γενόμενον.</p>
<p>This difficult and corrupt passage has
been severely treated by the critics. (1)
Soping’s conjecture aXuireKia ὡς Σοφοκλῆς
Μώμῳ has so far won acceptance that the
fragment is generally reckoned under the
title Μῶμος. So Nauck, who however
keeps ἀλωπεκίαι as the lemma. (2) Μ.
Schmidt, bracketing the words καὶ ἀλωπεκίαι
and ὅπεp. . . γενόμενον as belonging
to an earlier gloss, recasts the residue as
ἀλώπηξ· ὁ ῥαχίτης μυών, ὡς Σ. Ἰνάχῳ:
see on fr. 263. This is an extremely
violent proceeding, but it is (3) partially
accepted by Dindorf, who holds that the
explanation ἄρχησίς τις alone relates to
Sophocles, and apparently acquiesces in
Soping's Μώμῳ. Crusius on Herond. 7.
72 takes the same view as Dindorf. (4)
Ellendt follows Soping, but regards ἀλωπεκιᾷ
as a verb of the class discussed by
Rutherford, New Phryn. p. 153. The
general drift seems to me rather to be:
‘And ἀλώπηξ is used in scoffing at ἀλωπεκία,
as by Sophocles.’ But there
-evidently some corruption, and whether
it should be cured by such a reading as
ἀλωπεκίαν μωμω &#x003C;μένω&#x003E; ν (or could μωμᾶσθαι
take a dat. on the analogy of
μέμφεσθι?) is hard to say. It is anyhow
more probable, apart from metrical
considerations, that Sophocles, like Callimachus
and Herondas, preferred ἀλώπηξ
to the pseudo-scientific ἀλωπεκία. I conclude,
therefore, (1) that the
does not warrant the ascription of this
fr. to the Μῶμος; (2) that ἀλώπηξ should
take the place of ἀλωπεκία in the text.
ἀλώπηξ. Lobeck (paral. p. 317 n.),
illustrating κάπνος = οἶνος κάπνιος and the
like, quotes the use of ἀλώπηξ, ἐλέφας,
κύων, Κορύβας, οἶστρος for ἀλωπεκία, ἐλεφαντίασις,
etc. Cf. Callim. h. Art. 77 τὸ

<p>ΝΑΥΠΛΙΟΣ ΚΑΤΑΠΛΕΩΝ</p>
<p>ΝΑΥΠΛΙΟΣ ΠΥΡΚΑΕΥΣ</p>
<p>Four fragments are cited from the KarairXewv (425—428),
three from the πυρκαεύς (429—431), and five simply from the
Ναύπλιος without a distinctive addition (433, 434, 436—438).
Fr. 435 clearly belongs to the πυρκαεύς, if that was a separate
play. Now, the most famous incident connected with the name
of Nauplius was his conduct in displaying false lights on the
southern promontory of Euboea for the purpose of drawing the
Greek fleet on to the rocks, when driven before the storm, in
order that so he might revenge himself for the judicial murder
of his son Palamedes: Kur. Hel. 767 τὰ Ναυπλιου τ᾿ Εὐβοϊκὰ
πυρπολήματα, Verg. Αen. 11. 260 Euboicae cautes ultorque Caphereus1.
Hyginus (fab. 116), after referring to the death of
the Locrian Ajax, continues: ceteri noctu cum fidem deorum
inplorarent, Nauplius audivit sensitque tempus adesse ad persequendas
filii sui Palamedis iniurias. itaque tanquam auxilium
eis afferret, facem ardentein eo loco extulit, quo saxa acuta et locus
periculosissimus erat. illi credentes humanitatis causa id factum
naves eo duxerunt; quo facto plurimae eorum confractae sunt
militesque plurimi cum ducibus tempestate ocisi sunt membraque
eorum cum visceribus ad saxa illisa sunt: si qui autem potuerunt
ad terrain natare a Nauplio interficiebantur2. It is probable, but
not certain, that this story was related in the epic Nosti3, and in
a poem of Stesichorus bearing the same title4. But Sophocles
is the earliest authority to whom the narration of Nauplius’
treachery can definitely be ascribed; for it is patent that such
is the explanation of the title πυρκαεύς. Cf. Pollux 9. 156 ὁ
δ᾿ ἐμπρήσας τάχ ἂν πυρκαεὺς ὀνομάζοιτο κατ᾿ Αἰσχύλον καὶ
Σοφοκλέα οὕτως ἐπιγράψαντας τὰ δράματα, τὸν μὲν τὸν
τὸν δε τὶν Ναυπλιον.</p>
<p>The alternative title καταπλέων prima facie suggests the
existence of another play, unless a strong reason to the contrary
is forthcoming. After some hesitation, Welcker finally
concluded that there was only one play with a double name5;

and Dindorf took refuge in his familiar device of a new edition
published under a revised title. Now, the word καταπλέων must
mean either ‘landing’ or ‘returning by sea,’ and one of the chief
objections to the views of Welcker and Dindorf is that such a
title does not seem appropriate to a play with the plot that has
been sketched above. To this Welcker replied (1) that
may have been merely descriptive of Nauplius as the Sailor,
and without any relation to the plot. But that is a pure guess,
which is hardly consistent with the use of KarairXelv; and he
would evidently have preferred (2) the impossible alternative of
giving to καταπλέων a causative meaning. R. Wagner1, who
accepted Welcker's conclusion, explained καταπλέων as landing
in Euboea, and inferred that Nauplius was an Argive, who came
to Euboea for the special purpose of destroying the Greek fleet.
He relied on the words ἦκευ εἰς Εὔβοιαν in schol. Eur. Or.
But the hypothesis of a double title is altogether improbable;
and Welcker was only driven to adopt it, because he could find
no possible plot for the καταπλέων, and was unwilling to leave
the subject-matter unidentified.</p>
<p>A more plausible solution was proposed by Huschke2, who
interpreted KarairXecov as Lariding at the Greek camp near Troy,
and inferred that the play described the arrival of Nauplius to
exact retribution for the death of Palamedes, and the rejection
of his claim. He supported his contention by quoting schol.
Eur. Or. 432 Ναύπλιος δὲ ἀκούσας ἦλθεν εἰς Ἴλιον, δικάσαι τὸν
φόνον τοῦ παιδός· τῶν δὲ Ελλήνων κατολιγωρούντων αὐτοῦ, πρὸς
τὸ κεχαρισμένον τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν, ἀποπλεύσας κτἑ., to which may
now be added Apollod. epit. 6. 8 τοῦτο μαθὼν Ναύπλιος ἔπλευσε
πρὸς τοὺς Ἕλληνας καὶ τὴν τοῦ παιδὸς ἀπῄτει ποινήν· ἄπρακτος
δὲ ὐποστρέψας, ὡς πάντων χαριζομένων τῷ βασιλεῖ
κτἑ. There is nothing in the fragments quoted from the καταπλέων
which assists a decision; but, since the unjust condemnation
of Palamedes was the subject of the play so entitled, it
would seem that Sophocles must have largely readapted the
same material, if in another play he described the appeal of
Nauplius against the previous verdict. But that is not all;
for there are good grounds for thinking, as will be shown in
the Introductory Note to the Palamedes, that the arrival of
Nauplius was actually included in that play.</p>
<p>However, ’s theory is not the only possibility; for
there were many stories current concerning the malicious injuries
inflicted by Nauplius upon the murderers of his son.
<note type="footnote">1 Epit. Vat. p. 264 f.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 Anal. Crit. p. 241. The same view is adopted by Nauck, who accordingly

Thus, he punished Odysseus by throwing Penelope into the
sea (Eustath. Od. p. 1422, 8), and by causing his mother Anticlea
to hang herself on the receipt of false news relating to
her son’s death (scholl. Hom. λ 197, 202). Nor was his vengeance
limited to the house of the rival and accuser of Palamedes.
In Lycophr. 1093 he is described as τοιαῖσθ᾿ ἐχῖνος μηχαναῖς
οἰκοφθορῶν, spreading false news in the homes of the Greek
chieftains, and causing their wives to become faithless. In
particular, he was privy to the adultery of Clytaemnestra with
Aegisthus, he persuaded Aegialea, the wife of Diomedes, to
her ruin, and he incited Leucus, the foster-son of Idomeneus,
to usurp his power and destroy his wife and daughter. Cf
Apollod. epit. 6. 9 παραπλέων τὰς χώρας τας Ἑλληνίδας
παρεσκεύσαε τὰς τῶν Ἑλλήνων γυναῖκας μοιχευθῆναι, Κλυταιμνήστραν
Αἰγίσθῳ, Αἰγιάλειαν τῷ Σθενέλου Κομήτῳ, τὴν
Ἰδομένέως Μήδαν ὑπὸ Λεύκου· ἣν καὶ ἀνεῖλε Λεῦκος ἅμα Κλεισιθύρᾳ
τῇ θυγατρὶ ταύτης ἐν τῷ ναῷ προσφυγούσᾳ, καὶ δέκα
πόλεις ἀποσπάσς τῆς Κρήτης ἐτυράννησε κτἑ1. The arrival
of Nauplius on such an errand would naturally account for
the title καταπλέων, and I cannot help thinking that Lycophr.
1217 is significant in the same connexion:
<lg><l>ου γαρ ησυχος</l>
<l>πορκεὺς δίκωπον σέλμα ναυστολῶν ἐλᾷ,</l>
<l>Λεῦκον στροβήσων φύλακα τῆς μοναρχίας,</l>
<l>ψυδρῖσί τ᾿ ἔχθραν μηχαναῖς ἀναπλέκων.</l></lg>
There was certainly material enough for a tragedy in the ruin of
the house of Idomeneus2. It should be stated that R. Wagner3,
arguing from the words ὡς οἱ τραγικοὶ λέγουσιν used by Apollod.
2. 23 in reference to Clymene, the wife of Nauplius, derives the
major part of epit. 6. 8—11 from the τραγῳδούμενα of Asclepiades,
but separates from it the passage relating to the seduction
of the women, which he traces through the Nosti of Lysimachus
to an Alexandrian source. But this arbitrary division is not
generally approved4; for there is no reason to suppose that
this part of the Nauplius-myth is any later than the story of
<note type="footnote">1 Brunck quoted Tzetz. Lycophr. 384, which we now know to have been derived

<note type="footnote">2 See the n. on fr. 431. It should, of course, be observed that that fragment is

other voyagers to their death by kindling delusive flares. But at
last he himself met his end in the same trap through which he
had lured others to their destruction2. Nauplius here figures as
the piratical buccaneer, the terror of the high seas, who on his
return home is hoist with his own petard. The details are so
vaguely indicated that we cannot frame even the skeleton of a
tragic plot.</p>
<p>Lastly we may add that Vater3 disovered a subject for the
KarairXediv in the relations of Nauplius with Aleos and Auge,
supposing that the play was dramatically the earliest of those
which dealt with the story of Telephus. This is a solution which
few will approve.</p>
<p>Μ. Schmidt conjectured that the gloss of Hesych. I p. 251
ἀπολοίμιον φανόν· τὸν ἐπὶ δόλῳ, was taken from the Nauplius.</p>

The regular phrase is with the genitive

<p>Meineke's καί is the simplest remedy
for the syllable that is wanting: Papageorgius
prefers νιν. Tucker suggested
περιπεφραγμένον, i.e. ππεφραγμένον. — ρ
ἀσπιδίτης follows the analogy of αὐλίτης,
χωρίτης, ἀστίτης and the rest (fr. 92 n.).
— Dindorf writes πεφαργμένον here, and
the corresponding forms (ἔφαρξα, etc.)
wherever the verb occurs in tragedy, although
the evidence of the MSS is all the
other way. Photius supports ναύφαρκτον
in Ar. Ach. 95, and the inscriptional evidence,
though slight, indicates that ἔφαρξα
was earlier than ἔφραξα: see Meisterhans3,
p. 181. These facts are, however, hardly
sufficient to establish with certainty that
Sophocles would have preferred
πέφαργμαι.</p>

<p>427 Steph. Byz. quoted on fr. 426.
It is not altogether clear, as Papageorgius
pointed out, whether this fragment is
quoted from the Nauplius or from
another play. In printing the line as
interrogative I follow a suggestion of
Wecklein (Berlin. philol. Woch. 1890,
656). Blaydes conj. τις τοξότης or the
like, and μῶν for ὡς. There appears
to be a contrast made between the hoplite
(ἀσπιδοῦχος) and the archer. The comparison
is generally contemptuous of the
latter: Ai. 1120 ff. ὁ τοξότης ἔοικεν οὐ
σμικρὸν φρονεῖν. | . . . μέγ᾿ ἂν τι κομπάσειας,
ἀσπίδ᾿ εἰ λάβοις. Eur. Her. 159 ὅς
οὔτοτ᾿ ἀσπίδ᾿ ἔσχε πρὸς λαιᾷ χερί | . . .
ἀλλὰ τόξ᾿ ἔχων, | κάκιστον ὅπλον κτἑ.
The Scythians were typical bowmen
(Aesch. Prom. 737 Σκύθας δ᾿ ἀφίξῃ νομάδας
οἳ . . . ἑκηβόλοις τόξοισιν ἐξηρτυμένοι,
Cho. 160 Σκυθικά τ᾿ ἐν χεροῖν | παλίντο᾿
ἐν ἔγρῳ βέλη ᾿πιπάλλων Ἄρης), but their
introduction into tragedy is anachronistic.
The Persian wars brought them to the
notice of the Athenians, and the Scythian
police, public slaves and originally no
doubt recruited from a nucleus of Scythians,
were established at Athens by
Speusinus (schol. Ar. Ach. 54) early in
or towards the middle of the fifth century.</p>

in Etym. M. p. 666, 18 and Eust. Od.
p. 1396, 60 the same words are quoted
without an author's name. Eust. Od.
p. 1397, 29 Σοφοκλῆς ‘καὶ . . . βολαί.’</p>
<p>The reference is undoubtedly to the
inventions of Palamedes: fr. 479.—πεσσὰ
πεντέγραμμα. ‘The invention of πεττεία
and κυβεία was ascribed to Theuth, the
Egyptian Hermes (Plat. Phaedr. 274 D).
There are two forms of the game of
πεσσοί. (1) In the πέντε γραμμαί each
player had five ψῆφοι, one placed on each
of five lines. Between the two sets of
five lines was the ἱερὰ γραμμή (κινεῖν τὸν
ἀφ᾿ ἱερᾶς, “to try one's last chance”:
Poll. 9. 97). (2) The other form of
πεσσοί was called πόλεις, these being the
χῶραι or squares on the board (πλινθίον):
the pieces were κύνες. In both games the
object probably was to hem in and capture
the enemy's pieces (Dict. Ant. 11 11)’
(J.).—πεντέγραμμα appears to have been
first restored by Cobet (Ν.L. p. 775) for
the unclassical form πεντάγραμμα. The
rule is thus stated by Phrynichus: πεντάμηνον,
πεντάπηχυ· μετάθες τὸ ᾱ εἰς τὸ
ε&#x772;, πεντέμηνον λέγων καὶ πεντέπηχυ
(ccclxxvi R.). See also Ael. Dionys.
fr. 153 Schw., Moeris p. 207, 34. The
grammarian's dictum is borne out by the
stone records, for it is only in post-
classical times that the ε&#x772; passed into ᾱ,
owing to the analogy of τετρα-, ἑπτά,
ἐννέα and δέκα: see Meisterhans3, § 62, 3,
whose earliest example is πεντάμνους
(100 B.C.). Further evidence is given by
Lobeck, Phryn. p. 413. For the working
of analogy in the form of the compound
see Brugmann, Comp. Gr. 11 p. 28, E. tr.
— κύβων βολαί is not merely dicing, but
includes κυβεία, a game of skill corresponding
to our backgammon, in which
the luck of the κύβοι might be counter-
acted or improved by a skilful handling
of the pieces. Hesych. says: διαφέρει
δὲ πεττεία κυβείας. ἐν ᾗ μὲν γὰρ τοὺς κύβους
ἀναρρίπτουσιν· ἐν δὲ τῇ πεττείᾳ αὐτὸ
μόνον τὰς ψήφους μετακινοῦσι. See further
on fr. 947, and Dict. Ant. 1 695.</p>
<p>‘At the Greek Ilium (Hissarlik), on
the plain of Troy, they showed the stone
on which Palamedes used to play πεσσοί.
Polemon fr. 32 (FHG 111 125) Παλαμήδους
ἐπινοησαμένου κυβείαν καὶ πεττείαν
ἐν Ἰλίῳ εἰς παραμύθιον λιμοῦ κατασχόντος

Πολέμων ἱστορεῖ, ἐφ᾿ οὗ ἐπέσσευον’ (J.).
Orion (supr.) quotes the inscription on an
ἀβάκιον, containing 36 letters, one for
each square: εὗρε σοφός με παραιφασίην

<p>430 Hesych. 111 p. 141 ναύκληρον
πλάτην· ναυτικήν. Ναυπλίῳ πυρκαεῖ.</p>
<p>The explanation of Hesych. is probably
right, although there is not any
other example of the adjective employed
in this sense: ναυκληρία is used for voyage
in fr. 143. It may be suggested, however,
that the words would be admirably
adapted to describe the equipment of
Nauplius’ boat, of which he was at once
owner and navigator in his coasting voy-
ages (παραπλέων τὰς χώρας τὰς Ἑλληνίδας
Apollod. epit. 6. 9). Cf. Lycophr. 1217
πορκεὺς δίκωπον σέλμα ναυστολῶν, where
Tzetzes says: νῦν δὲ τὸν Ναύπλιον λέγει,
ἐπειδὴ εἰς ἁλιευτικὸν σκάφος ἐμβὰς ἔπλει.
Similarly Palamedes, when he went to
Troy, ἦγε . . . οὔτε ναῦν οὔτε ἄνδρα, ἀλλ᾿ ἐν
πορθμείῳ ξὺν Οἴακι τῷ ἀδελφῷ ἔπλευσε

was the subject of κρέμανται we do not
know, but I think no doubt can be felt
concerning the general character of the
context by anyone who will compare the
present passage with Hom. χ 468 ff ὡς δ’

οἴκτιστα θάνοιεν. | ἤσπαιρον δὲ πόδεσσι
μίνυνθά περ, οὔ τι μάλα δὴν. That is to
say, Sophocles compares the death by
hanging of malefactors or victims shamefully
slain to birds caught in a net. Can
any such incident be connected with the
story of Nauplius? It is a remarkable
coincidence that, if the plot of the
Ναύπλιος καταπλέων be such as has been
suggested in the Introductory Note, there
is a set of circumstances forming part of
the narrative which exactly fits the requirements
of the text. According to
Apollod. epit. 6 10 Leucus, having seduced
Meda, the wife of Idomeneus,
subsequently put her to death ἅμα Κλεισιθύρᾳ
τῇ θυγατρὶ ταύτης ἐν τῷ ναῷ προσφυγούσῃ.
And Lycophron, in his account of
the crime (1214—1225), ’hich he ascribes
to the treacherous cunning of Nauplius,
includes the sons of Idomeneus in the
list of victims: ὃς οὔτε τέκνων
οὔτε συγγάμου | Μήδας δάμαρτος, ἡγριωμένος
φρένας, | οὐ Κλεισιθήρας θυγατρός.
He adds that their death was shameful
and mysterious: πάντας δ’ ἀνάγνοις χερσὶν
ἐν ναῷ κτενεῖ, | λώβαισιν αἰκισθέντας
Ὀγκαίου βόθρου. Holzinger explains
this to mean that they were treated like
σφάγια sacrificed to the χθόνιοι: their
throats were cut while still alive, and
their blood allowed to drop into the
ditch. If they were hanged in a row
over the βόθρος, the disgrace was by so
much intensified.—Bergk (PLG III
wished to read &#x003C;καὶ&#x003E; κάτω

But this is a false trail, if the
comparison with the Odyssey is to be
maintained. He rightly abandoned his

cited presently concerning the several
discoveries. By far the best account of
Palamedes is in Philostr. her. 11.</p>
<p>J. translated vv. 1 —9 as follows: ’And
he it was who devised a wall for the
Argives' host: his was the invention of
weights, numbers, and measures; he
taught men how to marshal armies and
how to know the heavenly signs. He
was the first also who showed how to
count from one to ten and so to fifty and
to a thousand ; he showed how soldiers
may signal by beacons ; and revealed
things which before were hidden. He
discovered also how to measure terms
and periods of the stars, trusty signs for
watchers in the night-season ὕπνου
Φύλαξι)' ; or ’ trusty signs of the time of
rest for watchers' — i.e. of the time at
which one watch is to relieve another.
[Or, with Φυλάξεις; ' (he invented) the
watches of the night — trusty signs.']</p>
<p>There are, however, serious difficulties
in the traditional text which must now
be considered in detail. It is hardly
possible that Sophocles can have
written the lines as they stand and ill
their present order; but with our existing
material the task of restoration seems
almost hopeless.</p>
<p>2 This V. interrupts the natural connection
between τεῖχος and τάξεις (see
below) ; moreover, εὑρήματα is
awkward in combination with ηὗρε (or
ἐφηῦρε) ; and, lastly, there are no comnecting
links between τεῖχος and εὑρήματα
and between σταθμῶν and ἀριθμῶν. The
attempts which have been made to cure
these defects are not successful (see cr.
nn.); and I am inclined to think that
Posidonius — or whoever first compiled
the quotation — strung together a list of
the inventions from the play of Sophocles,
without regard to the links which originally
joined them. For the connexion of
Palamedes with weights, numbers, and
measures see Philostr. her. 11 . 1 πρὸ γὰρ
δὴ Παλαμήδους...οὐδὲ νόμισμα ἦν οὐδὲ
σταθμὰ καὶ μέτρα οὐδὲ ἀριθμεῖν, as well as
the passages cited above.</p>
<p>3 τάξεις is strangely joined with
σήματα, and that in turn is
from vv. 8 — 11, where the heavenly signs
are described more in detail. In view of
Philostr. her. 11. 3 τὰ δ’ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ Καὶ
εἴ τις τῶν ἄστρων ὰταξία τε καὶ τάξις,
where Odysseus replies to Palamedes' explanation
of the eclipse, it is tempting to
suggest that τάξεις here refers to the stars ;
but we must not disregard the constant
mention of military tactics as one of
Palamedes' most famous discoveries. See
especially Aristid. ii p. 339 Dind. ἓν

Cf. Dio Chrys. 13. 21 ἐπειδὴ δὲ
τούς τε ἄλλους ἐδίδαξε γράμματα καὶ τοὺς
Ἀτρείκας δῆλον ὅτι πρώτους, καὶ μετὰ τῶν
γραμμάτων τοὺς Φρυκτοὺς ὅτως χρὴ ἀνέχειν

ᾕδεσαν οὐδὲ καλῶς ἀριθμῆσαι τὸν ὄχλον
ὥστερ οἱ ποιμένες τὰ πρόβατα, where it
will be observed that exactly as here the
numbering is mentioned together with the
use of fire-signals. Aesch. fr. 182 καὶ
ταξιάρχας καὶ στρατάρχας καὶ ἑκατοντάρχας
ἔταξα. Plat. rep. 522 D ridicules the
capacity of Agamemnon as a general, if
he did not know how to count : ἤ οὐΚ
ἐννενόηκας, ὅτι Φησὶν (sc. Palamedes)
ἀριθμὸν εὑρὼν τὰς τε τάξεις τῷ στρατοπέδῳ
καταστῆσαι ἐν Ἰλίῳ καὶ ἐξαριθμῆσαι ναῦς

ὄντων καὶ τοῦ ’ Ἀγαμέμνονος, ὡς ἔοικεν,
οὐδ’ ὅσους πόδας εἶχεν εἰδότος, εἴπερ
μὴ ἠπίστατο; To the same effect
Aristides l.c. : ο δὲ τοσοῦτον ἀπεῖχον τοῦ
σύμπαντας ἂν αὐτοὺς ἀριθμῆσαι, ἢ
ὁπύσαι τινὲς ἦσαν ἃς ἦγον, ὥστ' οὐδ’
τινὲς αὐτοῖς οἱ βασιλεῖς ὅ τε
καὶ ὁ Μενέλαος ἕμελλον εὑρήσειν,
he is professedly quoting Plato. — In v. ὁ
the readings of Nauck and Gomperz (see
cr. nn.) may be provisionally accepted,
but the corruption probably lies deeper.
Keil held that the remains of two separate
lines had been combined in one.</p>
<p>7 can hardly have been written by
Sophocles as it stands. ’s trans-
position of ἔδειξε and ἐφηῦρε would be
an improvement, but even then the line
is suspiciously tame. Piatt (C.Q. v 66)
thinks that the strengthening of the
second verb by composition with a preposition
was characteristic of Sophocles, and
compares O.T. 1351 ἔρρυτο κἀνέσωσε.
For δεικνύναι of invention cf. Αnt.

<p>8 ἄστρων μέτρα. ' probably = spatia,
not as "distances," but as the "terms"
or spaces of time between the risings and
settings, etc, as measuring the seasons'
(J.). The meaning is then more exactly
defined by περιστροφάς, ' periods ’ or
Tavras (cr. n.) must either be deictic, or —
like the Latin iste (ille) — ’those wellknown':
Plat. Men. 76A ἐπίπεδον καλεῖς
τι καὶ . . .στερεόν, οἷον ταῦτα τὰ ἐν ταῖς
γεωμετρίαις; H. suggested the substitution
of τακτάς.

‘revolutions.’ περιστρέφω and περιστροφή
were scientific terms in astronomy: Plut.
de facie in orb. lun. 18 p. 931 Α ὃν γὰρ ὁ
ἥλιος περιιὼν κύκλον ἄγει καὶ περιστρέφει
περὶ τὴν σελήνην.</p>
<p>9 is corrupt and, however interpreted,
does not seem to be in the right place.
Hence the alteration in its position (see
cr. n. on v. 6), which Dindorf accepts.
Campbell's στικτά, ‘branded,’ is explained
as having the sense, (he discovered) ‘how
to put a mark upon their property.’ It
has not been observed (1) that the ascription
of the invention of φυλακαί to Pala-
medes in schol. Eur. l. c. is in favour of
φυλάξεις, (2) that σημαντήρια ought to
mean not ‘signs’ but ‘seals’ (Aesch.
Αg. 614). I suggest, therefore, φυλάξεις
θ᾿ οἷα, i.e. ‘and sentry-watches, which
are the seals making sleep secure.’ The
practice of sealing up valuables, in order
to keep them intact, was so common that
its metaphorical application is natural:
see the passages collected by Blaydes on
Ar. Thesm. 415, Lysist. 1199. Mekler
suggests τιθασά, ‘de stellis per noctis
silentium nautis viam indicantibus.’</p>
<p>10 τε connects στροφάς and δύσιν
with the preceding nouns, i.e, if v. 9 is
out of its place, with μέτρα and περιστροφάς.
For possible rearrangements
of the whole piece see cr. n.</p>
<p>11 ἄρκτου στροφάς. ‘If a season be
denoted, as the context suggests, στροφάς
may perhaps refer to the time in September
when Arcturus begins to appear
as a morning-star,—the “coming rould”
or “return” of Arcturus (Ο.Τ. 1137).
But it would more naturally mean “the
turning” of the Great Bear round the
pole. Track, 130. ἄρκτου στροφάδες κέλευθοι.
Hom. Σ 487 ἄρκτον θ᾿ . . . ἥ τ᾿ αὐτοῦ

μεσονυκτίοις ποτ᾿ ὥραις | στρέφεται ὅτ᾿
Ἄρκτος ἤδη | κατὰ χεῖρα τὴν Βοώτου. As
Greek seamen steered by the Great Bear,
the meaning is probably quite general.
According to Hygin. poet. astr. 2. 2,
schol. Hom. Σ 487, schol. Arat. 27, the
use of the constellation for navigators was
first taught by Nauplius, where he is no
doubt confused with his son. The proposal
of Maass to read ἄρκτου στροφεῖα
is based on Philolaus ap. Stob. ecl. 1
p. 18 Wachs. ἁ τᾶς σφαίρας ὁλκάς,—a
very fanciful application of an obscure
original: see Diels, Vorsokr.2 p. 244, 10.—
κυνὸς ψυχρὰ δύσιν ‘Galen, V p. 347 K.,
says that the ἐπιτολὴ τοῦ κυνός marks the
beginning of ὀπώρα, which ends with the
rising of Arcturus (Appendix on O. T.
1137). The ψυχρὰ δύαις would be about
Sept. 24, when Sirius sets with the sun.
This ends the “dog-days.” Pliny n. h.
2. 47 puts the rising of Canicula (Sirius)
15 days before Aug. 1, i.e. on July 16.
ψυχρὰν δύσιν, i.e. the autumnal setting, as
distinguished from the ἐαρινὴ δύσις, 19
days after the vernal equinox (according
to Pliny, n. h. 18. 69)’ (J.).</p>

with reference to τ 200). I have
added ἢ before καταιγίδας. The substance
of this, but not the reference to Sophocles,
occurs also in Eustath. Od. p. 1769, 32
(Ael. et Paus. fr. 225 Schw.). The word
was evidently obscure to the Alexandrians,
and it is possible that even Sophocles,
who no doubt used it with a traditional
meaning, would have been puzzled to
explain its history. Photius gives us the
choice of four explanations, of which
the third at any rate (‘dark, because scars
are black’) may be discarded. The note
of Photius is abbreviated and confused
by Hesych. 11 Ρ. 449 κατουλάδα· τὴν
κατίλλουσαν καὶ εἴργουσαν. βέλτιον δὲ
τὴν κατόλεθρον (πανώλεθρον conj. M.
Schmidt) καὶ συστροφὰς ἔχουσαν ἀνέμων.
Apollonius Rhodius evidently preferred
the derivation from ὄλλυμι (‘destructive’):
4. 1695 νὺξ ἐφόβει, τήν πέρ τε κατουλάδα

παρὰ Σοφοκλεῖ ἐν Ναυπλίῳ ‘νυκτὶ κατου-

<pb n="90"/>
λάδι.' Part of this scholium has found
its way into Etym. Μ. p. 497, 25, and
Etytn. Gud. p. 308, 19. But we cannot
leave out of account Hesych. 11 p. 440
κατειλάδα· ἡμέρα χειμερινή, οr 11 p. 27
εἴλας· ἀγέλας. ἢ πυΚνή. ἀγαθή.
where πυΚνή and σΚοτεινή seem to refer
to a lemma εἰλάς. The word may therefore
mean α thick, dark night (spissis
noctis se condidit umbris Verg. Aen. 2.
621), as Buttmann, Lexil. p. 271, explained
it, through κατειλεῖν ’to wrap up.'
Etymologically it would then be connected
with οὖλος 'fleecy' (lana),
οὐλάς ’a wallet.' The last explanation
of Photius is only a specialized application
of the first (fr. 70 n.). Campbell compares
Shakesp. Macb. 1.5.51 ’Nor heaven peep
through the blanket the the night.'</p>

Heath's conjecture with ἡμέρα for ἡ'τέρα).
This was rendered by Jebb : ' When
a man is in trouble, one night seems an
age; but, when he is enjoying himself,
day comes all too soon ’ (lit. ’ surprises
him'). For the sense Gomperz quoted
Sapph. fr. 130 εὔξασθαι νύκτα αὐτῇ γενέσθαι

μυρία resembles μυρίος χρόνος Ο.C. 397
617. For Φθάνω, which, if not here, is
nowhere found in the extant remains of
Sophocles, cf. Horn. A 451 Φθῆ σε τέλος
Θανάτοιο κιχήμενον, οὐδ’ ὑπάλυξας. I
cannot help suspecting, however, that the
general sense required is that which has
been fully illustrated by Headlam on
Aesch. Αg. 544, — sorrow so intense that
relief from it is desired even at the price of
immediate death. Add Dio Chr.68. 2. But
in that case something must have dropped
out : e.g. νύξ ἐστι, &#x003C; μόχθων δ’ ἤν
ἀναπαῦλαν λάβῃ, ἀρεστὸν > εὖ παθόντα θατέρᾳ
θανεῖν. This seems to have been
the meaning required by Bamberger, who
conjectured νύξ. εὖ παθόντ' εὖ δ' ἐστὶ
θητέρᾳ θανεῖν (!), and by Μ. Schmidt,
whose εὖ παθὼν τάδ’ εἶτ' ἐρᾷ θανεῖν εὖ
παρών τις A. Palmer) is equally impossible.
In favour of this view, it should be
observed that the chapter of Stobaeus is
entitled περὶ κακοδαιμονιας, and that
θατέρᾳ is elsewhere similarly corrupted.
Other conjectures are Seyffert's εὖ παθόντι
δ’ ἡμέρα Φανεῖ, Conington's εὖ παθόντα δ’
ἐστὶ δαρθάνειν, and Heimsoeth's εὖ παθόντι
δ’ εὐθέως Φθίνει. Ο. Hense preferred
νύξ, εὐπαθοῦντι δ’ εὐθὺς ἠμέρα Φανεῖ,
and Herwerden εὖ πάσχοντι δὲ μία μυρία.</p>

fighting with men, suggests a taunt
levelled against Nauplius, whose revenge
was wreaked against the Greek chieftains
by assailing the virtue of their womenkind:
see Introductory Note. Thus
Sarpedon's compliment in Hom. II 492

<p>Nauck conjectures that only the words
of fr. 888 belong to the Nauplius. No
cogent inference is possible, but the
locality (for which see on fr. 888) suits
the πυρκαεύς. — The ’Elymnian bower'
refers to the celebration at the Elymnion
of the rite of the ἰερὸς γάμος, as also at
the Euboean Ocha : Steph. Byz. p. 362
16 s.v. Κάρυστος. For a list of the places

The critics are not agreed whether
ἐφόλκαιον in Hom. is the rudder (so schol.
ΒPV, Apollon. lex. Hom. p. 315, Hesych.
II p. 243), or the lading-plank (Monro).
In Ap. Rhod. 4. 1609 ὁλκήιον is certainly
not the rudder, but we have no sufficient
reason to discredit the authority of Pollux.
Dindorf arbitrarily prefers ὁλκεῖα.</p>

<pb n="92"/>
<p>ΝΑΥΣΙΚΑΑ Η ΠΛΥΝΤΡΙΑΙ</p>
<p>The alternative titles are clearly established by a comparison
of Eustath. Od. p. 1553, 63 μάλιστα δέ, φασίν, ἐπεμελήθησαν
ὕστερον σφαιριστικῆς πόλεων μὲν κοινῇ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, βασιλέων
δὲ ὁ μέγας Ἀλέξανδρος, ἐδιωτῶν δὲ Σοφοκλῆς ὁ πραγικός· ὃς
ὅτε, φασί, τὰς Πλυντρίας ἐδίδασκε, τὸ τῆς Νανσικάας
σφαίρᾳ παιζούσης ὑποκρινόμενος ἰσχυρῶς εὐδοκίμησεν with A
20 F ἄκρως δὲ ἐσφαίρισεν (sc. Σοφοκλῆς), ὅτε τὴν Ναυσικάαν
καθῆκε. Cf. Eustath. Il. p. 381, 10 Σοφοκλῆς περιᾴδεται . . .
εἶναι σφαιρίσαι, ὡς ἡ κατ' αὐτὸν ἐδήλωσε δραματικὴ Ναυσικάα.
From these passages we also obtain the interesting information
that Sophocles abandoned his usual practice by appearing himself
as an actor in the title-role. Since he took the part of a
woman, his μικροφωνία was less of an objection than usual 1.
Though such stories must be accepted with reserve, it is probably
safe to infer that the Naiisicaa was an early play. Philyllius, a
poet of the Old Comedy, wrote a Πλύντριαι ἢ Ναυσικάα
and Eubulus, of the Middle, a Ναυσικάα (ll 188 K.).</p>
<p>The plot was of course taken from the sixth book of the
Odyssey, and its simplicity is remarkable ; for it may be considered
certain that Sophocles followed the Homeric narrative
as closely as the nature of his art allowed. Cf vit. Soph. 12
τούς τε γὰρ μύθους φέρει κατ' ἴχνος τοὐ ποιητοῦ καὶ τὴν Ὀδύσσειαν
δ' ἐν πολλοῖς δράμασιν ἀπογράφεται2. Ahrens makes the
plausible suggestion that Athena spoke the prologue and explained
the situation. There is no reason to suppose that the
story was recast in order to introduce a love-motive, and, unless
we make the improbable assumption of a change of scene, the
action cannot have reached to the departure of Odysseus from
Phaeacia. Fr. 781 probably belongs to this play, as is generally
supposed ; but there is less likelihood that Welcker was right in
his conjecture with regard to fr. 766.</p>
<p>There is no justification for the suggestion first made by
Casaubon 3 that the Nausicaa was a satyr-play.</p>
<p>Pausanias (1. 22. 6) mentions a picture by Polygnotus representing
Odysseus approaching Nausicaa and her maidens from
the river-bank, and from this a vase-painting of the same subject
now at Boston is supposed to be reproduced. Polygnotus, it is
suggested 4, had painted it as a votive tablet for Sophocles himself</p>
<note type="footnote">1 see See Introductory Note to Thamyras, 1 p.178.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 H. Schreyer, Naunkaa, Anh. Ρ. 135 f., thinks that the Nausicaa of Sophocles
was the first piece of a trilogy, in which the Phaeaces was the second, and perhaps
the Niptra the third.</note>

(Iw. Mueller, Ρ́·iυaίαίί.2, p. 82). It is
Ijest to assume that Soph, here follows
the ΟΑΨΠeΙ, and that ἐπενδύrἦ was
a word of general application, like ef/ia,

that the Ionian tunic was the subject of
reference, read ὐπe̓́δυτα, i.e. linen under-

is right, the error is earlier than the

ἐπedύτἦ was later in common use, but
was not found in Attic. He then quotes
exceptions from Soph., pseudo-Thespis
( TGF p. 8Π), and Nicochares. These
examples show that it was not a word of

Odysseus must have told his story at considerable
length, as in Homer. Ι suggest,
as an alternative, that the words formed
part of an account in ’hich the arrival of
Odysseus on the Phaeacian coast was

<p>Hom. Ω 602 — 617 is our earliest authority for the story of
Niobe, who vaunted herself against Leto, boasting that she was
the mother of many fair children, while Leto had borne only
two. Apollo and Artemis slew the sons and daughters of
Niobe ; and she herself was turned into stone, imprisoned
amongst the rocky crags of Mt Sipylus, where the tears that
bedewed her bosom were perennial streams of running water.
The legend of Niobe's transformation is undoubtedly to be
explained by a certain configuration of rock on Mt Sipylus, which
appeared to the people of the locality to resemble a weeping
woman. Pausanias, who was a native of the district, states
(1. 21. 3) that on a nearer approach the illusion disappeared;
and exactly the same account is given by Quintus, who no doubt
also wrote with the authority of an eye-witness (1. 293 — 306).
Although several suggestions have been put forward, the site

<pb n="95"/>
has not been identified with certainty by modern travellers :
see Frazer, Paiisanias, III pp. 552 — 555. Sophocles twice
incidentally to Niobe in her stony solitude as a type of unceasing
sorrow: see El. 150 — 153, Ant. 823 — 831.</p>
<p>Homer gives no hint of Niobe's parentage, nor any indication
that she dwelt elsewhere than in the neighbourhood of Sipylus.
Later tradition was unanimous in making her the daughter of
the Lydian Tantalus, and wife of the Theban Amphion. The
death of the children, therefore, took place at Thebes ; but the
schol. Townl. on Horn, Ω 602 1 gives the important information
that in Sophocles' play Niobe returned to Lydia after her
children had perished. The appearance of the same feature
in the account of Apollodorus (3. 47) tempts us to infer that
he was also following Sophocles, when he related that Artemis
shot down the daughters in the house, and Apollo killed all the
sons while hunting on Cithaeron. Hygin. fab. 9 is to the same
effect, except that he does not mention Cithaeron 2, for which he
substitutes m silva. Apollodorus made one son and one daughter 3
survive, and Hyginus one daughter only. It is, however, hardly
credible that Sophocles assented to a mitigation of ’s
suffering by allowing any of the children to escape. Ovid,
whose narrative (Met. 6. 146 — 312) is more detailed than any
of the other extant versions, shows a true poetic instinct in
leaving no survivors; and Pausanias (2. 21. 10), in the spirit of
an historical student, finds the authority of Homer convincing.
It is not possible to ascertain whether any of Ovid's rhetoric
is derived from a tragic source ; but it is worth notice that,
according to him, the sons were struck down by Apollo, not
while hunting on Cithaeron, but in the palaestra, where they
were practising athletic exercises. The daughters were killed
afterwards, as they stood mourning by their dead brothers, after
another defiant speech of Niobe. Here at least, as we shall see,
Ovid followed the order of events in Sophocles. For reasons
which are sufficiently obvious, Ovid felt himself obliged to
describe the transformation of Niobe as following immediately
after the death of her children and husband, as she sank amidst
their lifeless bodies and at once began to stiffen with grief. But,
since it was necessary to take into account the Sipylus-tradition,
he imagined Niobe as continuing to weep when she had become

entirely stone, and then as carried off to her native land by the
rush of a mighty whirlwinds The language recalls a passage
of Plutarch (cons. Apoll. 28, p. 1 16 C), which is founded on some
poetical account of Niobe's end : εἰ γοῦν ἡ Νιόβη Kara τοὺς
μύθους πρόχειρον εἶχε τὴν ὑπόληψιν ταύτην ὅτι καὶ ἡ
<lg><l>θαλέθοντι βίῳ</l>

τελευτήσει, οὐΚ ἂν οὕτως ἐδυσ χέραινεν ὡς καὶ τὸ
ἐκλιπεῖν διὰ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς συμφορᾶς, καὶ τοὺς θεοὺς ἐπικα·
λεῖσθαι ἀνάρπαστον αὐτὴν γενέσθαι πρὸς ἀπώλειαν τὴν
χαλεπωτάτην. Welcker claimed the quotation for Sophocles,
but Bergk included it in the lyric adespota (fr. 99)2, and Nauck
in the same class of tragic fragments (fr. 373). Note that, according
to Plutarch, Niobe preged to the gods that she might
perish. It can hardly be accidental that the same touch
reappears in Apollodorus, with the difference that there her
prayer to Zeus to be turned into stone is made after her return
to Sipylus3. Having already recognized points of contact between
Apollodorus and Sophocles, we might suggest that Niobe's
prayer came from the tragic poet ; but the link is too weak to
strengthen materially the title of Sophocles to the authorship
of the lyrics quoted by Plutarch.
Welcker thought that the appearance of Amphion was a
dramatic necessity in a play which described the downfall of
his family. He supposed therefore that, as in Ovid, he committed
suicide, and that his death was announced by a messenger
who came out of the house4. When the death of the sons took
place at a distance from the palace — on Mt Cithaeron it may
be —the news was brought to Niobe by their παιδαγωγός ; and
shortly afterwards the daughters were killed on the stage.</p>
<p>Welcker's acute guess has been confirmed by the new fragments
(fr. 442 ff.) published in the second volume of the Oxford
Papyri (1897)5. In the first of these one of the daughters is
represented calling for aid. In the second another, who is not

yet wounded, is compared to a colt let loose from the yoke.
The situation has been ingeniously analysed by Robert in Herm.
XXXVI 368 ff.1 The first Niobid died on the stage, but the Nurse,
who followed her out, had her body carried into the palace by
servants. Niobe appeared shortly after the arrival of the second
daughter, who died in her arms. Then she learnt from a messenger
that her sons had been slain on Cithaeron2. In fr. 448
Plutarch has quoted an extract from this messenger's speech.
It is not pretended that this reconstruction rests on a secure
foundation; but it is consistent with the meagre indications
afforded by the evidence.</p>
<p>A more difficult question is raised by the longer fragment
published among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (frs. 574, 575), which
contains a speech of Tantalus, referring first to the fate of
Niobe, and afterwards to his own misfortunes. So much at
least appears to be certain, although some doubts have been
expressed 3. Moreover, a strong case has been made in favour
of Sophoclean authorship4, and the first editors and some other
critics treated it as an extract from the Niobe. But, although
Sophocles transferred the heroine to Lydia at the end of his
play, it is hard to see how such a speech can have belonged
to it. Wecklein's expedient5, that the fragment is taken from
a messenger's speech, is scarcely tenable : to attribute the verses
to another than Tantalus does violence to their natural trend,
and the arrival of a messenger from Lydia is inconsistent with
the requirements of the situation. Are we then to suppose a
change of scene? I think that Robert was justified in his
vigorous protest that an epilogue enacted in Lydia is absolutely
excluded by the conditions of the Greek stage. How,
for example, was the chorus — composed of Theban women, as
Welcker thought — to cross the sea? Niobe herself (he might
have added) was conveyed by a storm-wind ; but that circumstance
does not help to preserve the continuity of the action.
And, if these objections were not decisive, the assumption of
a double catastrophe, the earthquake at Sipylus immediately
succeeding the disaster at Thebes, would be hardly credible.
It should be added that G. Hermann, relying on the statement
of the Homeric scholiast, proposed to refer to Sophocles an
obscure passage in Arist. poet. 18. 1456a 16, where, in distin-

guishing the structure of epic and tragedy, the critic remarks
that dramatists who have attempted to include a multiplicity of
stories in a single tragedy have failed conspicuously; and gives
as an instance those who, unlike Aeschylus, have taken as their
subject the whole tale of Niobe. The Oxyrhynchus fragment
might certainly be used in support of Hermann's guess, but
more convincing evidence is required before we can attribute
to Sophocles such an artistic lapse. The Homeric scholium, as
Robert remarks, admits of a simple and obvious explanation :
either Niobe announced her own departure, or her destiny was
proclaimed in a divine ἐπιφάνεια. What then is to be made
of the Oxyrhynchus fragment? Wilamowitz1, agreeing that it
referred to Niobe, forbore to decide between Aeschylus and
Sophocles. But the arguments of Blass in favour of Sophocles
have not been refuted. Now that we have better reason to
credit the existence of the Tantalus of Sophocles, I suggest
that the new fragment should be assigned to that play, and have
endeavoured to show in the Introductory Note that it is suitable
to the circumstances of the story.</p>
<p>Valckenaer, followed by Welcker, Dindorf, and Wilamowitz2,
attributed to Sophocles the verses printed by Nauck among the
adespota (fr. 7):

<p>identification is of course not certain, but
it is highly probable, and no other has
been suggested.</p>
<p>The same critic in Rh. Mus. LV 96 ff.
published a revised text after a minute
examination of the originals, and his
results have been incorporated above.
As regards the order of the fragments, Blass
thinks it possible that 445 might have
stood above 443 and 444 above 442.
Then, 443, 11 might have preceded 444
1, so that the four fragments would have
formed a continuous text. It will be observed
that Robert's reconstruction, which
is mentioned in the Introductory Note,
does not agree with this order. There is
another fragment, published in Hibeh
Paryri I p. 45 (see p. 40), which was considered
by the editors to belong to the
same group. Inasmuch, however, as the
remains are quite insignificant, and the
identification is uncertain, it has not been
reproduced here.</p>
<p>This fragment is a dialogue between
one of the daughters, who has just been
struck, and the chorus. Blass completes
V. 2 with κόρης, and v. 3 with τήνδ' ad
δρόμῳ, and begins v. 4 with οὐδ’. It is
assumed that ἀστοχίζεσθαι, a word
hitherto unknown, means ' to miss the
mark.' The daughters were slain by
Artemis ( ApoUod. 3. 46) ; and she, therefore,
must be the subject of ἐξελαύνεις
and ἀστοχίζῃ. But, since v. 1 apparently
belongs to the lyrics of the Niobid, the
adoption of Blass's supplements involves
the difficulty of reconciling an address to
Artemis in v. 3 with a reference to her in
the third person in v. 2. There is perhaps
another possibility, — that v. 3 f. are
addressed to the Niobid, and that πόδ'
ἐξελαύνεις should be written, followed by
δωμάτων τ' ἀφειμένη (or ἐξώπιος) καταστοχίζῃ,
if καταστοχίζεσθαι might be
understood as ' to be shot at. ’ Then v. 2
might run σὺ δ’ ἀλλὰ. . .φόβῳ. Blass completed
V. 4 with εἰσέδυ βέλος.</p>
<p>6 πότεπον has been proposed as a
supplement, but ἐκεῖσε τῇδ' do not combine
satisfactorily. — ἐπουρίσω: observe
the sea-faring metaphor, and see on

<p>Tragedy fixed the number of Niobe's
children at fourteen for subsequent traditon:
see Ov. Met. 6. 182 f., Hygin.
fab. 11 ApoUod. 3. 45, etc. According
to Aelian var. hist. 12. 36, Lasus of
Hermione was the earliest authority for
this number. Aeschylus agreed (TGE
p. 50). Before this there had been much
diversity. Hesiod (fr. 61), Mimnermus
(fr. 19), Pindar (fr. 65), and Bacchylides
(fr. 52 J.) mentioned twenty, although
Hesiod (according to another authority)
had spoken of nineteen, Sappho (fr. 143) of
eighteen, and Alcman made the number
ten: see Aelian, l.c. Gruppe, Ρ. 125 1251
accounts for the differences between
twelve and fourteen and between nineteen
and twenty by the subsequent addition
to the list of Chloris and Meliboea,
said to be the names of surviving
daughters, or of one of them.
Headlam in C.R. XIII 3 suggested. that
the number fourteen was chosen as suitable
to the composition of a tragic chorus;
but, so far as Sophocles was concerned, we
know for certain that some at least of the
daughters were acting parts.</p>

<p>The same scholia attest the reading ἦ
in O.T. 1123, 3, where L has ἦν. L presents
ἦ only in Ο.C. 973, 1366 : see Jebb on
O.C. 768. Modern editors restore ἦ in
tragedy wherever metre permits, ἦν is
nowhere required in Aesch. or Soph., but
occurs occasionally before a vowel in
Euripides : see Rutherford, JVew Phrynichus,
p. 243, and add Hel. 992. Cobet
(N.L. p. 187), who was among the
earliest to call attention to Porphyrius'
note, observes that even the examples

<pb n="102"/>
which he quotes are corrupted by the
copyists. The fact that Porphyrius is
obliged to quote instances in support of
ἦ shows, as Dindorf justly remarked, that
the text of the dramatists had early suffered
corruption in this respect.
προφερτέρου undoubtedly seems to</p>
<p>bear the meaning elder; nor is there
valid reason for denying it to the word
either here or in O.C. 1531 τῷ προφερτάτῳ
μόνῳ σήμαινε, where Jebb is perhaps unnecessarily
cautious. Few will, I think,
be satisfied with Campbell's rendering,
' For I was dear to him who is mightier
than they.' Is it possible to adjust the
line to what we know of the plot?
Welcker thinks that the speaker is one
of the daughters lamenting the death of
her favourite brother. In that case it is
certainly odd that we have προφερτέρου
rather than προφερτάτου ; and of course
the terminations are often confused.
Hartung, who reads προφερτάτῳ, seems
to imagine that προφερτάτου is the reading
of the MSS. One might guess that one
of the daughters — perhaps Chloris,
according to one version was the only
survivor — had been beloved by Apollo,
the elder of ’s two children. There
is evidence of a previous friendship
between Leto and Niobe in Sappho's (fr.

<p>Dindorf, Hartung, Ellendt, and Campbell
ignore the lacuna after ὦ; consequently,
Ellendt gives the impossible
rendering m me curando te occupa, and
Hartung the equally impossible ' ‘umhüllemich,
mich, mein Schild ! ’ Nauck merely
remarks ’post ὦ videntur verba non
nulla ’ as if the gap were no
more than a probability. This is all the
more strange, since Wyttenbach (1797)
had long since recorded the defect in the
MSS. According to Bernardakis, there is
a space in B sufficient for nine letters and
in Efor twelve. He suggests therefore ὦ
φίλτατ' αἰτῶ σ’ ἀμφ' ἐμοὶ (or ἀμφ' ἔμ' εὖ)
στεῖλαι πέπλον. ἀμφ' ἐμοί had previously
been proposed by Papageorgius, but it is
uncritical to fill the gap with words which
require an alteration in the text. I should
prefer something like ὦ &#x003C;φίλε, φίλε,
&#x003E;ἀμφ᾿ ἐμοῦ, στεῖλαι. . ., without
whether στεῖλαι means ‘ start
come hither ’ or not. Mekler, adopting
a suggestion in Nauck's first edition that
the words οὐδένα βοηθὸν ἄλλον οὐδὲ σύμμαχον
were part of the text of Sophocles,
proceeds: &#x003C; καλοῖμ' ἄν > ·ὦ &#x003C; Φίλ' >
ἐμοῦ στεῖλαι &#x003C; χροί > . He compares
Bacch. 821.</p>
<p>The allusion to the ἐραστής is confirmed

version the beauty of Niobe's children
was an essential element in the story
(Parthen. 33 εἰς ἔριν ἀφικομένην Λητοῖ

that παιδεραστία was νόμιμον at Thebes:

identical with Etym. Μ. except that he
has δερμηστής, omits τὰ before δέρματα,
and substitutes ἐτυμώτερον οὕτω καλούμενος
for ἐΚ τοῦ ἔδω. That δερμηστής
should be preferred to δερμιστής is indicated
not only by the frequent occurrence
of the corruption τευχιστήν is a variant
for τευχηστήν in Aesch. Theb. 631), but
also by the derivation from ἴδω which it
would be unreasonable to doubt, fortified
as it is by the analogy οφ ὠμηστής, νήστης,
Βρωμηστής Εtym. Μ. p. 215, 58 βρ.
χορτοφάγος· Καὶ όνος διὰ λιμὸν ὀγκούμενος),
ὀγκηστής (see Stadtmueller on Α. Ρ. 9.
301), and possibly ἀλφηστής. It is
probable that all these compound words
ought to be accented paroxytone, as
suggested by Lobeck (Paralip. p. 450 :
see also Chandler, § 35). I have no
doubt that the reference is to a grub
which lived on dried animal matter such
as hides. The δερμηστής is a literary congener
of the σής and the κίς: Pind. fr.

The citation of Lysias is significant that
we have to do with an object of common
experience, although Aristotle, who discusses
this class of insect in hist. an. 5.
32. 557b 1 ff., does not specifically mention
δερμηστής. He says (8 ff.): Καὶ ἐν τοῖς
βιβλίοις ἄλλα γίγνεται (sc. ζῷα) τὰ μὲν
ὅμοια τοῖς ἐν τοῖς ἱματίοις, τὰ δὲ τοῖς σκορπίοις
ἄνεν τῆς οὐρᾶς, μιαρὰ πάμπαν· Καὶ
ὅλως ἐν πᾶσιν ὡς εἰπεῖν ἔν τε τοῖς ξηροῖς
ὑγραινομένοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς ὑγροῖς ξηραινομένοις,
ὅσα ἔχει αὐτῶν ζωήν. Thus far
I am in agreement with Μ. Schmidt
(Didym. p. 21), but am unable to follow
him when he suggests that Soph, was
comparing a rolling wave to the movement
of the δερμηστής, and that the
Hesychian gloss (11 p. 29) εἰλυσπᾶσθαι·
τὸ παραπλησίως τοῖς ὄφεσι Καὶ τοῖς
ἰέναι may belong here, as if the
words were ὃς εἰλυσπᾶτο δερμηστοῦ
We have no materfal which enables us
to understand the nature of the difference
between the interpretations of Aristarchus
and Didymus, but it may be hazarded
that the controversy was merely whether
the δερμηστής — on whose identity they
agreed — could be more correctly described
as ὄψις or σκώληξ. Ellendt considered
that Aristarchus preferred the form δερμιστής,
and understood it of the serpent
changing his skin : but that is very unlkely.
It is perhaps not irrelevant to
quote from a letter of the poet Cowper,
in answer to a criticism directed against
his use of ' worm ’ in place of ' serpent ’ :
' They are, however, without all doubt,
convertible terms. A worm is a small
serpent, and a serpent is a large worm ’
(Letters of W. Cowper, ed. J. G. Frazer,
I p. 332). Schmidt thinks that the unknown
grammarian who differed from
Aristarchus and Didymus must have been
Orus or Cassius Longinus, but is inclined
to attach too much importance to the
controversy; for I cannot believe that
δερμηστής was unintelligible to the Alexandrians.
See further on fr. 635. It
should be added that Dermestes is the
name given by zoologists to the type of
the genus Dermestidae, a branch of the
Coleoptera which comprises about 400
species. The Dermestidae in the larval
state nearly all live on dried animal
matter (such as bacon-rind) and are very
destructive ; the name is at least as old as
Linnaeus (c. 1758). The larval forms of
beetles are, I am told, usually designated
' worms ’ by those who are not zoologists.
Thus the common ’ meal-worm ’ found in
flour is really the larval form of a beetle
Tenebrio.</p>

form, with the bend in the left pipe,
may be seen in the illustration given by
Guhl and Koner, Fig. 241 i, or in Dict.
Ant. 11 841. There seems to have been
some doubt whether ἔλυμος was more
properly the name of a part of the flute
or of the flute itself: Hesych. 11 p. 71

characteristic of the Phrygian flute was
its deep note: Athen. 185 A, quoting
βαρὺν αὐλόν from Ion fr. 42, οὕτω λέγων

horn-shaped addition is attested also by
Hesych. 11 p. 7 s.v. ἐγκεραύλης. Hence
Berecynthio coru in Hor. Carm. 1. 18. 13.
It seems highly probable that the spread
of the worship of the Great Mother
familiarized the Greeks with this type of
flute. See generally v. Jan in Pauiy-
Wissowa II 2421.</p>

<p>There is hardly any evidence elsewhere
of a special connexion between the crocus
and the cult of Demeter, though baskets
of flowers of all kinds are often amongst
her attributes. There is no special sig-
nificance in the inclusion of the crocus
in the list of flowers which Persephone
was gathering when she was seized by
Pluto (Hom. h. Dem. 6). Schneidewin
pointed out that κροκωτοί, saffron-coloured
robes, were worn by the women at the
Thesmophoria, or festival of Demeter
θεσμοφόρος (Ar. Thesm. 138). But this
fact is not conclusive, inasmuch as the
colour appears also to be characteristic of
self-dedication to the service of other
deities : see the evidence collected by
Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 444, and especially
Ar. Lys. 645 with the scholia.</p>
<p>ΞΟΑΝΗΦΟΡΟΙ]</p>
<p>The title is only once quoted, and is of doubtful authenticity.
Welcker (p. 66) first drew attention to the difficulties inherent in
the supposition that the chorus consisted of gods fleeing vanquished
before mortal warriors, or despairing at the capture of
an earthly city. He inferred, accordingly, that the original
statement from which the scholium was drawn did not relate to
a play bearing the title Ξοανηφόροι; but that Sophocles merely
recorded, perhaps in the Laocoon. (cf. fr. 373), the fact of the

<pb n="105"/>
gods' appearance after the capture of Troy, each carrying his
own image on his shoulders. Later criticism has done nothing
to diminish the force of Welcker's objections. But it is not so
easy to account for the corruption. If we assume that the
adjective ξοανηφόροι was a part of Sophocles' description, and
that the passage in which it occurred subsequently acquired
some repute, the words εἴρηται ἐν ξοανηφόροις may have had an
intention similar to that of ἐν τοῦ σκήπτρου τῇ παραδόσει
in Thuc. 1. 9. Or ἐν ξοανηφόροις may have taken the place of

indicated by the title, and further confirmation may be drawn
from Arist. poet. 14. 1453b 33, where, in discussing the case of
a man killing his kinsman in ignorance, he points out that this
may occur ἔξω τοῦ δράματος, as in the Οedipus of Sophocles, or
ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ, οἷον ὁ Ἀλκμέων ὁ Ἀστυδάμαντος ἢ
Τηλέγονος ὁ ἐν τῇ τραυματίᾳ Ὀδυσσεῖ.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the death of Odysseus by the hand of
Telegonus, his son by Circe, were first reduced to a literary form
in the epic Telegonia, the last of the Cyclic poems, generally
attributed to Eugamon (or Eugammon) of Cyrene, and dated
c. 568 B.C. The excerpt of Proclus, so far as it is relevant to the
present purpose, mentions (EGF p. 57) the return of Odysseus
from Thesprotia after the death of Callidice1, and continues
as follows. Meanwhile Telegonus, the son of Circe2, who was
voyaging in search of his father, landed in Ithaca, and plundered
the island. Odysseus came out to attack him, and the son unwittingly
slew his father. On discovering his mistake, Telegonus
conveyed his ’s body to ’s island, and took with him
Penelope and Telemachus. Circe made the three others immortal,
whereupon Telegonus was mated with Penelope, and
Telemachus with Circe. Apollodorus (epit. 7. 36) repeats most
of this, with the addition that the spear with which Telegonus
wounded Odysseus had a point made from the κέντρον of a
roach3. Eustathius (Od. p. 1676, 45), commenting on λ 133
explains that the spear of Telegonus was designed by Hephaestus
with a head of adamant, a golden shaft, and a point made as
stated above, and that the roach had been killed by Phorcys
because it devoured the fish in lake Phorcis. He also emphasizes
the significance of a death which, coming from the sea, slew at
last the sea-worn hero, and refers to the verses of Oppian
(Halieut. 2. 497 ff.):
<lg><l>κεῖνό ποτ' αἰγανέῃ δολιχήρεϊ κωπηέσσῃ</l>
<l>Κίρκη Τηλεγόνῳ πολυφάρμακος ὤπασε μήτηρ,</l>

Hephaestus made the spear at the request of Circe. From Hygin.
fab. 127 several fresh points emerge : (I) that Telegonus was driven
to Ithaca by a storm, and was forced by hunger to ravage the fields ;
(2) that Telemachus accompanied Odysseus in his attack on the
raiders ; (3) that the death of Odysseus was in accordance with an
oracle, quod ei responsum fuerat ut a filio caveret mortem ; (4) that
the return to Aeaea and the subsequent marriages took place in
consequence of the command of Athena. There are also remarkable
differences in detail, which may be thought to indicate a dramatic
origin, in the narrative of the ὑπόθεσις to the Οyssey first
published by Buttmann from a Palatine MS and reprinted in Dindorf's
edition of the scholia (l p. 6, 13 — 23) : καὶ βιώσας χρόνους

<p>It is evident from the allusions in later literature to the
parricide of Telegonus1, and to the deadly weapon by which
Odysseus was killed2, that the general outline of the story had
become a familiar theme3.</p>
<p>So far there is no particular difficulty in forming a conception
of the manner in which Sophocles may have dramatized this
material. Especially, we cannot fail to observe that the reiterated
references to Dodona in frs. 455,456, 460 and 461 are satisfactorily
explained by the statement in Hyginus and the Argument to
the Odyssey that Odysseus, like Laius and others 4, had been
warned by an oracle to beware of his own son. Observe also
that we have two forms of the story, according to which Odysseus
either went out of attack robbers or resisted the attempt to make
a forcible entry into his house. Some may think fr. 458 agrees
better with the former version, though it is scarcely decisive.</p>

<p>But, when we endeavour to determine how Sophocles linked
the arrival of Telegonus to the earlier history of Odysseus, the
enquiry becomes more complex. Frs. 453 and 454 show that
the prophecy of Tiresias in the eleventh book of the Odyssey
was included in the scheme of events preliminary to the action ;
and it may be assumed that the dramatist accepted the circumstances
in which Odysseus met his end as fulfilling the earlier
prophecy1 as well as the oracle given at Dodona : θάνατος δέ τοι
ἐξ ἁλὸς αὐτῷ | ἀβληχρὸς μάλα τοῖος ἐλεύσεται, ὅς κέ σε
γήραι ὕπο λιπαρῷ ἀρημένον, ἀμφὶ δὲ λαοὶ | ὄλβιοι
Odysseus, then, had returned from his last journey, undertaken,
it would seem, in order to make the offering to Poseidon which
Tiresias had enjoined, and in the course of his travels in Epirus
had learnt at Dodona of a specific danger threatening his life,
which appeared to be inconsistent with the earlier forecast. The
alternative title requires us to assume that Odysseus was not
recognized on his return, and that his identity was discovered by
the old nurse in the same manner as in the Odyssey2. Also, it
has been inferred from fr. 457, as well as from certain fragments
of Pacuvius3, that, as in Homer, Odysseus related his adventures
at considerable length. But how can Sophocles have imposed
such a feeble duplicate upon an audience which knew perfectly
well that all this had happened before? Wilamowitz4 escaped
from the difficulty by supposing that the story adopted was
a substitute for and not a sequel to the latter part of the Odyssey.
The situation of Odysseus at the time of his return was the
same as that described in the fictitious narratives of ξ 321 ff. and
τ 271 ff. 5 Moreover, the whole of the struggle with the suitors
was omitted6. He gets rid of this part of the history by taking
a hint from β 113 ff. where Antinous suggests to Telemachus
that he should send his mother back of the house of her father
Icarius, so that she may be betrothed from there. Penelope,
then, had been sent to Sparta, and Wilamowitz finds an allusion
to this event in Pacuv. fr. IV Spartam reportare instat: id si
’ perpetrat. Ingenious as this is, we shall not readily believe that
Sophocles would have put forward a version of the Return of
Odysseus so fundamentally at variance with the whole scheme
<note type="footnote">1 Ameis-Hentze (Anh. to λ 134) think that the whole story was built on a false

of the Odyssey, while at the same time he followed that poem
so closely in certain of its details 1. Another attempt of a similar
kind was made by Svoronos, who explained the title Νίπτρα as
referring to the bathing of the hero's foot, after he had been
wounded by the poisonous barb2. But this ignores the evidence
of the Pacuvian fragments, even if the title — already appropriated
to the scene in the Odyssey — could have been applied to an
entirely different situation. Ribbeck 3 called attention to another
important consideration. If Odysseus returned openly to Ithaca,
why was he not recognized at once? However much protracted
the period of absence, he had no longer — after the death of the
suitors — the same motive for landing secretly. Ribbeck consequently
inferred that he came back in disguise because of the
danger against which he had been warned by the oracle at Dodona,
that he was recognized by the nurse, and that he bound her over
to secrecy. Pacuv. fr. I shows that the recognition took place on
the stage. Ribbeck very fairly remarks that, though the fragments
indicate that Pacuvius introduced a narrative of the adventures,
fr. 457 is not enough to prove that Sophocles elaborated the theme,
as if Odysseus were returning home for the first time. It might
be urged against Ribbeck that for Odysseus to return to Ithaca in
disguise rather than openly was the most likely method of incurring
the very danger which he was anxious to avoid. But he
is certainly right in suggesting that his first object after receiving
the answer must have been to protect himself against Telemachus4.
We must apparently assume that at this juncture Telemachus
was ruling as his ’s deputy, and continued friendly to him.
At least, there is nothing to suggest the contrary; but the desire
to shun the presence of Telemachus, and to get back to Ithaca
so as to put in motion a scheme for his removal from the island 5
may have prompted Odysseus to show himself first to Eumaeus,
in whose hut the recognition by Euryclea might then have taken
place. If Odysseus desired to return without the knowledge of
Telemachus, the dramatic advantage of the scene with the nurse
is obvious. Or we might suppose, as an alternative, that
Telemachus was temporarily absent from home. In either case,
there is a strong reason for suspecting that Sophocles was the
source of the version quoted above from the Argument to the

Odyssey, so far as it relates to the precautions taken against
Telemachus, and the circumstances of Telegonus' arrival.
Especially significant is the statement that Odysseus, hearing
the noise, Thought that it was caused by Telemachus, and leapt up
sword in hand.</p>
<p>We assume, then, that the action of the earlier part of the
play was directed towards the attainment of security by Odysseus,
when he believed that Telemachus was the source of the threatened
danger. So soon as this seemed to be composed by the voluntary
withdrawal of Telemachus, the inmates of the house were disturbed
by the boisterous summons of Telegonus. The conclusion
of the play must have comprised a messenger's description of the
conflict, and a scene in which the mortally wounded Odysseus
was brought on the stage 1, the parentage of Telegonus was
ascertained 2, and a reconciliation with him was effected. To
this part of the play, when the prediction of the oracle was
apparently falsified, frs. 460 and 461 no doubt belonged, though
Welcker3 was hardly right in supposing that the oracle at Dodona
was mentioned for the first time at this point. This essential
matter must have been made known to the audience at an fearly
stage, as has already been indicated. It is clear that the final
scene resembled in many respects the conclusion of the Trachiniae;
but whether Wilamowitz was right in pressing the parallel so far
as to include in it the betrothal of Penelope to Telegonus at the
bidding of Odysseus must remain an open question. Vürtheim
thinks that Athena did not appear ex machina, but that the
concluding scene is correctly represented in the Argument to
the Odyssey.</p>

<p>These are the words addressed to
Odysseus by the stranger whom he was
destined to meet, according to the prophecy
of Tiresias, after he had reached the land
of those to whom the sea was unknown:
Hom. λ 127 ὁππότε κεν δή τοι συμβλήμενος
ἄλλος ὁδίτης | φήῃ ἀθηρηλοιγὸν ἔχειν ἀνὰ
φαιδίμῳ ὤμῳ.—τὸ δῶρον has been suspected:
Nauck pronounced the words
‘vix Sana,’ Μ. Schmidt proposed πέλωρον
uniting the fragment with 454 (ποδαπὸν
πέλωρον ἀ. φ. ἔ. | ὤμοις ἀθηρόβρωτον
ὄργανον φέρεις), Wecklein τόδ᾿ ὤμοις, reducing
the text to a single line, and
assuming that fr. 454 preceded it, Campbell
τόδ᾿ ἔργον, and Mekler τὸ λῶρον. But it
is idle to alter the tradition. I suggest
that δῶρον is used in the sense of a votive
offering (usually ἀνάθημα: but see the
instances quoted by Rouse, Greek Votive
Offerings, p. 3238, and in the index at
p. 418), and that the stranger suspected
Odysseus of an intention to dedicate to
the god whose precinct he was approaching
the odd-looking tool which he was carrying
on his shoulder. In Homer, at any rate,
the oar is to be dedicated to Poseidon by
Odysseus, presumably because he has done
with the sea and has no more need of it:
λ 129 καὶ τότε δὴ γαίῃ πήξας εὐῆρες
ἐρετμόν, with which may be compared
Theocr. 7. 155 ἆς ἐπὶ σωρῷ | αὖτις ὲγὼ
πάξαιμι μέγα πτύον. Rouse, op. cit. p. 70,
finds no direct evidence for this custom in
classical times, but considers it in accordance
with Greek ways of thought. In
A. P. 6. 4, among the offerings from the
fisherman Diophantus to Poseidon, are
καὶ τοὺς ἐξ ἀκάτων διχθαδίους ἐρέτας.—
Dindorf is not justified in discrediting the
grammarian's interpretation of ποδαπόν
as = ποῖον. Similarly Apollon. de synt.
1.3. 26 ἐπὶ ἐθνικῆς ἐννοίας ποδαπός λέγομεν,
ᾗ ἔσθ᾿ ὅτε ἀνθυπάγεται καὶ τὰ ἐν ποιότητι,
ὅτε λέγομεν, ποδαπός ἐστι Τρύφων, μέλας
ἢ λευκός. The testimony of Phrynichus
is not so clear (Ρ. 56 Lob., p. 128 Ruth.);
but Rutherford was too hasty in denying
the possibility of ποδαπός = ποῖος in Attic.
There is at least a play upon the double
sense in [Dem.] 25. 40 τίς οὖν οὗτός ἐστι;
κύων νὴ Δία τοῦ δήμου. ποδαπός; οἷος οὓς
μὲν αἰτιᾶται λύκους εἶναι μὴ δάκνειν ἃ δέ

We have also the analogy of παντοδαπός,
for which see the examples collected by

—ἀμφὶ . . . ὤμοις is less accurate here than
in Homer's ἀμφ᾿ ὤμοισιν ἔχει σάκος (Λ 527).

Eustathius to the νεώτεροι, who thought
‘a spoon to stir porridge’ a more appropriate
taunt of the landsman. On the
other hand, the παλαιότεροι were agreed
that both Hom, and Soph, intended the

Eustathius cites his authorities so vaguely.</p>

<p>455 Steph. Byz. p. 248, 2, quoted

<p>For the heteroclite form Δωδῶνι see
Jebb on Track. 171 — ὁ νάιος is an
obscure title of Zeus which seldom occurs
in literature. Dem. 21. 53: oracles from
Dodona order the Athenians to send
θεωροί with three oxen and two sheep to
each ox τῷ Διὶ τῷ Ναΐῳ. Inscriptions
considerable numbers are found in honour
of Zeus Naos and Dione at Dodona
(A. B. Cook in C. R. xx 370). The
explanation of the title is disputed, but
the prevalent view is that it is connected
with νόω (ναίω) ' to flow ’ (see on fr.
and was given to a local god, worshipped
at a fountain which sprang from the foot
of the sacred oak (O. Kern in Pauly-
Wissowa V 1 261). Schrader, however,
holding that ναῦς and ναός are both descended
from a word meaning 'tree,'
interprets Ζεὺς Νάιος as ' der im
gefasste.' The ancients also connected
the word either with (1) ναῦς, or
(2) ναός ; and the latter view has recentlybeen
upheld by Th. Reinach (Rev. Arch.
vi 97 ff.), who compares for the development
of Νάιος from Ζεὺς Ναός that of
Κεραύνιος from Ζ. Νεραυνός. If this explanation
is correct, the title is comparable
with Ζεὺς βωμός on an inscription
Syria: see C. Q. 111 231. It would seem,
however, that Sophocles in this passage
favours the derivation from ναίω, perhaps
as signifying ' the god who dwells (in the
oak)': A. B, Cook in C. R. XVII 178
compares Φηγωναῖε the reading of Zenodotus
in Horn. II 233 with Hes, fr. 134

<p>The priestesses at Dodona have been
the subject of much discussion ; but the
material evidence, which is collected in
Jebb's Trachiniae, p. 202 ff., need not be
repeated here. The uncertainty of modern
inferences may be estimated by the fact
that, while Gruppe (p. 354), regarding the
doves as possessing magical powers over
the weather, makes the three old priestesses
the original custodians of the rain-charms,
Kern (in Pauly-Wissowa v 1262) thinks
that the institution of priestesses was
temporary and late, being due to the
influence of Delphi. The following points
should be observed, (1) There is no
decisive evidence earlier than Pausan. 10.
12. 10 that the priestesses at Dodona
were called Πεχειάδες: see Farnell, Cults
of the Greek States, I p. 39 n. (2) Strabo
329, with whom the schol. on Trach. 172
agrees, records two conjectural explanations
of the Dodonaean doves: either
(a) the flight of the doves was observed
and interpreted by the priestesses, or
(b) there were no doves, but only women
at Dodona; and the mistake was due
to old women being called πελίαι in the
Molossian dialect. (3) As Soph, mentions
both doves (Trach. 172) and priestesses
as oracular, he must either be regarded as
a witness in favour of Strabo's first alternative,
or as giving to the priestesses the
name Πελειάδες (Jebb in loc.). In the
latter case we should still have to explain
why they were so called. It has
recently been suggested with some plausibility
that they represented a class of
magicians who, by intimate association
with the birds, had learnt to understand

<pb n="113"/>
their language, and, as their interpreters,
wore a kind of bird-dress when giving response
to their questioners (W. R. Halliday,
Greek Divination, p. 265 ff.). (4) Herod.
2. 55 —57 vouches vouches the existence of three
priestesses at Dodona, but tries to explain
away the story about a speaking dove.
Kern is therefore not justified in saying
that Soph, is dependent upon Herodotus.</p>
<p>ἱερέας is a shortened form of ἱερείας
which is completely established by the
evidence collected in Meisterhans 3, Ρ. 40 :
it occurs on inscriptions fourteen times
from the fifth century onwards. It follows
that ἱερίας, restored by Valckenaer and
accepted by Dindorf, is wrong. The
forms with ε should be restored four times
in Euripides, viz. Or. 261, Ι. T. 34
1399, Bacch. 1 1 14, in all of which the
Mss give ἱέρειαι etc. except that in Or.
and the schol. have ἱερίαι.</p>

whether it was elided or not, τ' ἐλαιάεσσα
or τε λαιάεσσα: — just as in Hom. ι 116

doubted whether to read λάχεια or ἐλάχεια:
other cases may be seen in Pind. fr. 244
and schol. Ar. Ach. 690.' (H.)</p>
<p>Of the various interpretations offered
by the lexicographers there cannot be
much hesitation in preferring that which
makes ἐλαιάεσσα the equivalent of λιπαρά
('oily paunch'), for there is no evidence
that νηδύς can be used in the metaphorical
sense of ’vale’ or ’hollow,’ like γουνός.
This view is supported by the Homeric
description of the Cyclops: ι 296 αὐτὰρ
ἐπεὶ Κύκλωψ μεγάλην ἐμπλήσατο νηδύν.
Cf. Eur. Cycl. 243 σφαγέντες αὐτίκα Ι

of the adj. with ἔλαιον rather than ἐλαία
L. Dindorf compared Npnn. 5. 226 φόρτον
ἐλαιήεντος ἐκούφισεν ἀμφιφορῆος.</p>
<p>The fantastic explanation of Photius
suggests that ἐλαιάεσσα could stand for
' Sicilian ’ ; for ἀπὸ μέρους is the current
jargon of the scholia to express pars pro
toto: see schol. Ai. 17 κώδων . . . ἀπὸ μέρους
δὲ τὴν σάλπιγγά φησι, Track. 680
δὲ ἀπὸ μέρους τῷ βέλει. It appears therefore,
fore, as has been pointed out, that Σικελή
has dropped out in the second entry of
Hesychius. It is a curious coincidence
that the weapon with which Odysseus
blinded the Cyclops is described as μοχλὸς

<p>The story of Odysseus feigning madness in order to avoid
the obligation of joining the Trojan expedition is not mentioned
in Homer, but his reluctance to take part in it is implied in
ω 115. In that passage the shade of Agamemnon recalls to
Amphimedon, one of the suitors of Penelope, how he and Menelaus
had stayed in his house, when visiting Ithaca for the purpose
of persuading Odysseus to sail with them. The scholiast
explains that Odysseus did not hold back through cowardice,
but because his wisdom enabled him to gauge the serious nature
of the struggle. The ultimate source of Sophocles' play is to be
found in the Cypria, which Proclus abstracts as follows (EGF
p. 18): καὶ μαίνεσθαι προσποιησάμενον τὸν Ὀδυσσέα ἐπὶ τῷ μὴ
θέλειν συστρατεύεσθαι ἐφώρασαν, Παλαμήδους ὑποθεμένου
υἱὸν Τηλέμαχον ἐπὶ κόλασιν1 ἐξαρπάσαντες. Apollodorus (epit.
3. 7), who may be following the same original, is somewhat more
explicit, stating that Palamedes detected the fraud by seizing
the child Telemachus from his mother's arms and threatening
to slay him with a drawn sword. Further details are given by
Hyginus (fab. 95). Odysseus had learnt from an oracle that, if
he went to Troy, he would return destitute and without his companions
after the lapse of twenty years. Accordingly, he
pretended to Agamemnon and Menelaus that he was mad,
assumed the sick man's head-gear2, and yoked a horse and an
ox to the plough. Palamedes perceived the imposture, and,
taking the child Telemachus from his cradle, put him beneath
the plough with the words : ' Lay aside your sham and join the
’ Lucian (de dom. 30) describes a picture of the ploughingscene,
which agreed with the version of ApoUodorus in representing
Palamedes as drawing his sword upon the child.
Philostratus (her. 11. 2), who says that the story is mentioned
by many poets, agrees with Hyginus as to the constitution of
the team, but Lycophr. 815 ff., and Tzetzes in loc., substitute
an ass for the horse. Eustathius (Od. Ρ. 1696, 20) and Lucian
(l.c) merely state that different animals were yoked together.</p>
<p>Various allusions to the subject show that its popularity was
chiefly due to the tragic poets : see Lucian de salt. 46, Arist. poet.

invention, and quotes a speech of Ajax — apparently from the
Armorwm iudiciuni of Pacuvius or Accius (fab. inc. XXXI R.) —
taunting Ulysses with breaking his oath 1. Sophocles himself
referred to the story in Phil. 1025 καίτοι σὺ μὲν κλοπῇ τε κἀνάγκῃ
ζυγεὶς Ι ἔπλεις ἅμ’ avroh, much in the same way as it was mentioned
in Aesch. Ag. 832. There is thus ample evidence that
the legend was current in the early part of the fifth century, but
it is improbable that it formed the subject of the Palamedes of
Aeschylus 2.</p>
<p>We have no means of ascertaining how Sophocles dramatized
the material, or whether his version was the same as that epitomized
by Hyginus.</p>

<p>2 I have accepted Dindorfs συντέμνων:
‘ my speech is brief, making a

of the terminations of the infinitive and
the participle is common (e.g. O.T. 11 70).
J. writes : ' Can the text be defended ?
Perhaps thus : μῦθος γὰρ βραχύς, for my
story is a short one, ὥστε) Ἀργολιστὶ

Cf. Hdt. 2. 24 ὡς μέν νυν
δηλῶσαι, πᾶν εἴρηται (followed by ὡς δὲ
ἐν πλέονι λόγῳ δηλῶσαι, ὦδε ἔχει).' But,
if the infin. is attached to βραχύς ἐστι),
the meaning ought to be ' the speech is
too short for abbreviation ’ : see Plat.
Menex. 239 B ὁ Χρόνος βραχὺς ἀξίως

result : ' to speak briefly, my speech is
brief.' For Argive brevity see on fr. 64.

There can hardly be any doubt that
κρεκτοῖσι, first preferred by L. Dindorf, is
right. κρέκω is strictly to strike a stringed
instrument with the plectrum, as contrasted
with ψάλλω, to use the fingers for
the same purpose. Thus κρετοῖσι νόμοις
should apply to a strain sung to the
accompaniment of the lyre. Cf. Ap.
Rhod. 4 908 (Orpheus with his lyre
makes music to drown the song of the
Sirens) ὄφρ' ἄμυδις κλονέοντος ἐπιβρομέωνται

αἰόλον ἐν κιθάρᾳ νόμον ἔκρεκον· ἐν δὲ

But κρέκω is sometimes equivalent
to ψάλλω: Telest. fr. 5 τοὶ δ’ ὀξυφώνοις
πηκτίδων ψαλμοῖς κρέκον Ι Λύδιον
ὕμνον, Α. Ρ. 9. 433. See also on fr. 238.
And it is used even for the music of the
flute : Ar. Αν. 682 ἀλλ' ὦ καλλιβόαν κρέκουσ'
Ι αὐλόν. Aesch. Cho. 818 ὁμοῦ
κρεκτὸν γοητῶν νόμον is unfortunately
corrupt. Without the context we cannot

<p>As ἔμπειρος is for ἐμ-περ-ιο-ς, ἐμπερής

On the other hand, the Attic πέρας corresponds
to the Ionic πεῖραρ and the
Lesbian irippara (i.e. περ-ζατα etc.) :
Brugmann, Comp. Gr. Ι p. 146 E. tr.
ἐμπερής is entirely isolated, unless the
Alexandrian ἐμπέραμος is to be taken
into account. The latter word seems to
have no analogous formations in the -mo
(-iTimo-) class, and, if it has any claim to
independence, efjLwdpafxos must be due to
the influence of ἔμπειρος. For ἐμπέραμος:
ἐμπερής Lobeck (Path. Prol. p. 156) compares
ἰταμός: ἴτης. But the

to the εσ- stems. Blaydes compares

φυλλολοεῖν, ἐνθουσιᾶν,
Εὐριπίδης Λικυμνίῳ (fr. 478) Καὶ Σοφοκλῆς</p>
<p>θριάζειν was derived, no doubt incorrectly,
from θρῖον: hence the gloss
φυλλολογεῖν. Cf. Etym. Μ. p, 455, 45
θρῖα· κυρίως τὰ τῆς συκῆς φύλλα · καὶ
θριάζειν, τὸ φυλλολογεῖν· δηλοῖ δὲ καὶ τὸ
ἐνθουσιάζειν. But θριάζειν ' to be inspired'
or ' possessed ’ is connected with
a group of words which show clearly the
same radical idea. Thus θρίασις is
by Suid. s.v. θρίαμβος as ἡ τῶν
ποιητῶν μανία. θρίαμβος, a hymn sung
in procession in honour of Dionysus,
belongs to the same root, but is influenced
by the analogy of ἴαμβος. Probably
διθύραμβος should be added, as formed
from δι-θρίαμβος, whatever is the origin
of the first syllable: see Sturtevant in
Class. Phil. V 330. Here belong also
the rare words θρίσσειν and θριᾶσθαι : see
for the former Erotian p. 77, 5 θρίσσειν·
μαίνεσθαι, ὡς καὶ Ἀριστοφάνης ὁ
(fr. 69 Nauck). θρίσσειν δὲ φασὶ τὸ
κατὰ ψυχὴν ἐξίστασθαι, and for the latter,
which is glossed by μαντεύεσθαι, Bekk.
anecd. p. 265, 15, Etym. Μ. p. 455, 42.
But the most interesting member of the
group is θριαί, the name given to pebbles
used in divination αἱ μαντικαὶ ψῆφοι) :
see Frazer on Pausan. 7. 25. 10. They
were personified as the Thriae, and
localized on Parnassus as the nurses of
Apollo: for a full account of them see
Allen and Sikes, Homeric Hymns,
Ρ. 312. Hesych, 11 p. 325 gives Θριώ
as ἑορτὴ Ἀπόλλωνος, and the same origin
may be assumed for the Thriasian plain
at Eleusis (this was where Athena threw
down the θριαί, when she was told that
they belonged to Apollo: Etym. Μ.,
Bekk. anecd.), and tlie Thriasian gate at
Athens (Plut. Μαί. 30), For ἐνθριάζω
see on fr, 544. Βlaydes's proposal to
substitute θυρσάζειν (Ar. Lys. 13 13) is
misconceived.</p>

Σοφοκλῆς Ὀδυσσεῖ· τὸν μέγαν. τὸν ἀπομάσσοντα
Καὶ καθαίροντα. This obscure
gloss is to some extent elucidated by
a comparison with Hesych. ΙΙΙ p. 62
μαγμόν· τὸ καθάρσιον. ἀπομάσσειν γὰρ
λέγουσιν ὅταν περκαθαίρωσι τοὺς ἐνοχλουμένους
τινὶ πάθει. The presence of
ἀπομάσσειν in both passages can hardly
be accidental, and, although μαγμός is
not such a formation as we should expect
for the nomem agentis, μαγνον is altogether
unintelligible. So also Hesych. in p. 61
μαγίδες· αἶς ἀπομάττουσι καὶ καθαίρουσι.</p>
<p>Ellendt was probably right in ejecting
τὸν μέγαν as a Byzantine interpolation,
suggested by magnus. Barker had corrected
the text of Photius to μάγον. . .τὸν
μαγέα, and Naber, who agrees as to the
lemma, thinks that the reference is to
Ο. Τ. 387 and that Ὀδυσσεῖ is an error
for Οἰδίποδι. For ἀπόμαγμα see on
34. Blaydes conj. μάκτην. It is impossible
to determine whether the fr.
belongs here or to the Νίπτρα. Dindorf
assigned it to the latter, but the subjectmatter
rather suggests the Ὀδυσσεὺς
μαινόμενος.</p>
<p>It is perhaps worth observing that
schol, N on Horn, Ω 482 says τὸν δὲ
καθαίροντα καὶ ἁγνίτην ἔλεγον, but ἁγνίτην
can hardly have become μαγνον.</p>

<p>Pollux 10. 39 and schol. V Ar. Eq. 498 quote the Iocles of
Sophocles, but no such person as locles is known to the mythograghers.
Hence Welcker, following a suggestion of Brunck,
and bringing frs. 313 and 1125 into the same connexion, inferred
that locles was a mistake for Iphicles. But, whereas Brunck
declared for the brother of Heracles, Welcker agreed with
Boeckh (Tr. Gr. princ. p. 129) that Iphiclus the son of Phylacus
— occasionally known as Iphicles — was meant. The story of
Iphiclus and the brothers Melampus and Bias is told in Hom.
λ 286 — 297, and was well known in later times ; see e.g. Prop.
2. 3. 5 1 ff. But the constant recurrence of the form Ἴφικλος is
against Welcker's view, and the argument which he draws from
the schol. on Apoll. Rh. 1. 54 is based on an error. Dindorf
advocates an alternative suggestion of Brunck that Ἰοκλῆς was
an error for Οἰκλῆς, and supports it by showing that the same
corruption occurs in Eur. Suppl. 925, schol. Hom. λ 326, and
Diod. 4. 68. The mistake is curiously persistent, occurring at
least five times in the MSS of ApoUodorus (1. 68, III. 3, 60, 63
87), and probably also in schol. Eur. Phoen. 133 Περιβοίας τῆς
Ἱππόνου τοῦ Ἰοκλέους τοῦ Ἀστακοῦ κτἑ. Assuming then that
the title locles is due to corruption, it is difficult to resist the
inference that it should be replaced by Oecles. Welcker answers
that nothing is known of Oecles making it likely that he would
have given his name to a tragedy. That is true ; but it is also
possible that he was a character in the Alcmaeon (cf ApoUod. 3.
87), or perhaps even that he was represented as the companion
of Heracles on his expedition against Laomedon (Apollod. 2.
134). Ahrens makes an alternative suggestion, that the subject
of the play was the appeal of Alcmaeon to his grandfather for
assistance and his rejection by him ; but, even if the text of
ApoUodorus warrants the inference drawn from it, the material
is scarcely sufficient for more than an episode.</p>

ἐν τῷ Ἰοκλεῖ λέγοντι ἀλλὰ καὶ] λινορ- λινορραφῆ τυλεῖα: linen-woven cush-
ραφῆ τυλεῖα.' Fritzsche rejected the ions. τύλη was used in the κοινή for a
words ἀλλὰ καὶ, which are more likely cushion, but the Atticists insist that the

<pb n="120"/>
proper Attic word was κνέφαλλον.
Moeris, p. 201, 20 κνέφαλον ἀττικῶς,
τύνη ἑλληνικῶς. Phrynichus (CLI R.)
τύλην, εἰ Καὶ εὕροις που, σὺ κνέφαλον λέγε.
Hesychius is more obscure (11 p. 497):
κνέφαλον· τύλη. ἣν δὲ ἡμεῖς τύλην,
τυλεῖον. But his meaning appears to
be (so Lobeck, Phryn. p. 174) that,
though κνέφαλλον is the general term,
τυλεῖον was sometimes found in Attic.
For the occasional appearance of τύνη in
the same sense Pollux quotes Eupolis
(l.c.) and Antiphanes in the Φάων (fr. 214
II 104 K.), and cites the compound
τυλυφάντης from Hyperides (fr. 125 K,).
The further statement that τύλη in Eupolis
was an lonicism must be understood to
mean that an old-fashioned word sometimes
held its place. At any rate, τύλη
in the sense of cushion was not peculiar
to that dialect, for it is so used twice in
Sappho (frs. 50, 81). Herodian περὶ
μοι. λεξ. p. 39, 12, who quotes these
passages, insists as strongly as the Αtticists
that κνέφαλλον was the correct Attic
term, and adds the words ὁμωνύμως τῷ
περιεχομένῳ τὴν περιέχουσαν, i.e. the
wrapping is called by the same name as
is properly given to the stuffing. Thus
we conclude that κνέφαλλον originally
meant flock (Plat. fr. 97, 1 627 K. ὥσπερ

on which the schol. remarks, παρὰ τὸ

<p>It is not clear from the schol. schol.'s comment
how much of the text is taken or parodied
from Sophocles. — ἀλλ' ἴθι χαίρων occurs
also in Nub. 510 and Pac. 729 at the
opening of the κομμάτιον, where the actors
are dismissed from the stage: so Vesp.
1009 ἀλλ' ἴτε χαίροντες ὅποι βούλεσθ',
Ach. 1 143 ἴτε δὴ χαίροντες. But similar
formulae of farewell or dismissal are
found in tragedy: Track. 819 ἀλλ' ἑρπέτω
χαίρουσα, Eur. Phoen. 921 χαίρων ἴθ'· οὐ
γὰρ σῶν με δεῖ μαντευμάτων, Alc. 811
χαίρων ἴθ'· ἡμῖν δεσποτῶν μέλει κακά,
Hipp. 1440 χαίροθσα Καὶ σὺ στεῖχε.
Shortly afterwards (Eq. 548) Aristophanes
recurs to the same phrasing : ἵν' ὁ ποιητὴς
ἀπίῃ χαίρων, Ι κατὰ νοῦν πράξας, Ι φαιδρὸς
λάμποντι μετώπῳ. — κατὰ νοῦν, = ex animi
sententia, is found also in O.C. 1768
ἀλλ' εἰ τάδ' ἔχει κατὰ νοῦν καίνῳ. κατὰ

used by Sophocles: see the comm. on

<p>The evidence for this title is meagre and inconclusive : see
the notes on frs. 321, 732 and 26. The popularity of the subject
— the misfortunes of Oeneus in his old age — affords perhaps
some slight presumption that it was dramatized by Sophocles,
as well as by Euripides (TGF p. 536), Chaeremon (ib. p. 786),
and Philocles (Suid.). Cf. Timocles fr. 6, 16 (11 453 K.)

<p>ΟΙΝΟΜΑΟΣ</p>
<p>Out of seven fragments ascribed to this play five are quoted
from the Oenomaus, one from the Hippodamia, and one without
any title. Most critics rightly treat the reference to the Hippodamia
as an error on the part of Stobaeus or his authority,
affording yet another instance of the substitution of the name of
one of the principal characters for the usual title of the play
(Introduction, § 1). But this evidence is not such as to require
us to follow Nauck in giving to the play the alternative titles
Οἰνόμαος ἢ Ἰπποδάμεια 1; the cases of the Nausicaa and
Niptra are not analogous. On the other hand, it is improbable
either that Sophocles handled the same material twice, or that
the title Hippodainia related to the story of Chrysippus.
Ribbeck's conjecture 2 is equally unlikely. He concludes from
frs. 471, 473, and 477 that the Oenomaus was a satyr-play, but
that there was also a tragedy entitled Hippodamia, to which only
frs. 472 and 474 belong.</p>
<p>The story of Pelops and Oenomaus is most fully related in
Apollod. epit. 2. 3 —9. Oenomaus, king of Pisa, had a daughter
Hippodamia, and either because he was himself enamoured of
her, as some would have it, or owing to an oracle which foretold
that her husband would kill him, prevented her betrothal by
putting her suitors to death. For he made it a condition of
assent to his daughter's marriage that the candidate for her hand
must take her with him on his chariot, and endeavour to escape
to the Isthmus of Corinth ; and that he himself should be at

liberty to kill the suitor, if he overtook him. Having armour
and a chariot given to him by Ares, Oenomaus was successful in
destroying many aspirants 1, and nailed the skulls of his victims
in a row against the wall of his palace — a warning to future
candidates. At length Pelops appeared, whose beauty so fired
the passion of Hippodamia that she implored Myrtilus, the son
of Hermes and charioteer of Oenomaus, who was himself in
love with her and ready to do her a favour, to assist her lover
against her father. Myrtilus, accordingly, caused the chariot of
Oenomaus to be overturned by omitting to insert the pins in the
naves of the wheels ; and the king, unable to extricate himself
from the reins, was mortally injured, or (according to others)
slain by Pelops. Recognizing that he had been cheated,
Oenomaus with his dying breath invoked a curse upon Myrtilus.
Pelops proceeded on his journey with Hippodamia and Myrtilus.
But on a certain occasion, when Pelops had left his car in order
to fetch a draught for water for Hippodamia, Myrtilus attempted
to violate her. Hearing of this from his wife, Pelops, being then
in the neighbourhood of the promontory of Geraestus, threw
Myrtilus into the sea which was subsequently called Myrtoan.
Then Myrtilus, in his turn, cursed the race of Pelops as he fell.
Pelops travelled as far as the Ocean-stream, and, having been
purified by Hephaestus, returned to Pisa, and succeeded to the
sovereignty of Oenomaus.</p>
<p>Before the commencement of this narrative ApoUodorus
(epit. 2. 3) relates that Poseidon gave to his favourite Pelops
a winged car, which could pass over the sea without wetting its
axle. This statement corresponds with the account of Pindar
(Ol. 1. 70 ff.) in which the victory of Pelops appears to be the
immediate consequence of the gift of the car (v. 86): τὸν μὲν
ἀγάλλων θεὸς Ι ἔδωκεν δίφρον τε Χρύσεον πτεροῖ- | σίν τ' ἀκάμαντας
ἵππους. Ι ἕλεν δ' Οἰνομάου βίαν Ι παρθένον τε σύνευνον. Thus
there would seem to have been an early version of the story in
which Pelops succeeded by grace of Poseidon and the virtue of
his magic car, so that the connivance of Myrtilus was not
required 2 It should be added that nothing is known as to the
appearance of the story in the epics, except that the suitors of
Hippodamia were catalogued in the Hesiodic Eoeae 3. Still,
it is certain that Myrtilus was at an early date a prominent
figure in the legend ; for, apart from the evidence which connects
him with Elis, the narrative of ApoUodorus coincides in several

respects with the account attributed to Pherecydes (FHG 1 94)
by the scholiasts on Soph. El. 504 and Apoll. Rhod. 1. 752.
The incidental allusions to Myrtilus in Soph. El. 504 and Eur.
Or. 990 treat him as the original cause of the misfortunes of the
Pelopidae; and this is sufficient to show that he must have
played an important part in the tragedies which dealt specifically
with the fate of Oenomaus. Euripides also wrote an Οenomaus,
which was probably produced with the Phoenissae in 409 1. It
was thus later than the present play, which was certainly earlier
than 414 2; but the fragments of Euripides give no indication of
the character of his plot. Further, since we cannot tell whether
Accius imitated Sophocles or Euripides in his Oenomaus, no
inference can be drawn from the Latin fragments.</p>
<p>It becomes pertinent to enquire how Sophocles contrived the
intervention ΟΙ Myrtilus. In the account given by Hyginus
(fab. 84) the love-motive is entirely absent. There Pelops is
frightened by the failures of his predecessors, and bribes Myrtilus
by promising him half of the kingdom as a reward for his
assistance. Subsequently, when returning homewards, he began
to fear the disgrace of acknowledging the plot, and, wishing to
avoid the consequences of keeping his word to Myrtilus, threw
him into the sea. Other variations are extant. Thus in Pausan.
6. 20. 17 it is said that Myrtilus acted so as to cause the horses
of Oenomaus to shy. This is simply an inference from the
epithet ταράξιππος, a title applied to Myrtilus, when worshipped
as a hero in Elis. In Pausan. 8. 14. 11 Myrtilus is a lover of
Hippodamia who was bribed by the promise that he should
enjoy her company for one night. But, when subsequently he
reminded Pelops of his oath, he was thrown overboard. The
reference to an oath induced Ribbeck3 to make use of the story
for the elucidation of fr. 472. The grossness of the details
makes us loth to assign it to Sophocles, although the allusion
in itself agrees well enough with the requirements of the supposed
situation. It should be observed, however, that in the account
of Apollodorus no bribe is mentioned; and the oath may have
been exacted from Myrtilus by Hippodamia as a guarantee that
he would perform his undertaking. In any attempt to discover
the main outlines of the plot of Sophocles, the importance of
fr. 474 must not be overlooked. This agrees so remarkably well
with the words of Apollodorus4, that we may safely reject the

version of Hyginus, and infer that Hippodamia took the chief
part in persuading Myrtilus to assist Pelops.</p>
<p>Pisa was undoubtedly the scene of the action, as was also the
case in the play of Accius (frs. IV and X). Frs. 471 and 473
suggest that soon after his arrival, which is perhaps referred to
in fr. 475, Pelops was reminded of the gruesome fate which had
overtaken former suitors. Fr. 476 is part of a chorus sung during
the progress of the contest, from which we may perhaps infer
that, as in ApoUodorus, the course extended from Elis to
Corinth.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say whether the sequel was announced by
a messenger, or whether Pelops and Hippodamia returned in
person. It will be observed that Geraestus is mentioned not
only by ApoUodorus and in other late texts 1, but also by Euripides2,
as the scene of Myrtilus' death. Our authorities have
not been careful to explain what Pelops was doing in Euboea,
or how he got there. But, if we recognize that his possession of
the magic chariot, which moved as easily over sea as over land,
is implied in the whole of Apollodorus' narrative, the solution of
the difficulty is brought a step nearer. Myrtilus was thrown
into the sea, as they were passing along the coast of Euboea in
the course of a journey across the Aegean. And when Apllodorus
adds that Pelops was purified by Hephaestus before he
returned to Pisa, we may conjecture that Lemnos was the goal
towards which they were travelling. There is clearly a reminiscence
of the voyage across the sea in Pausan. 8. 14. 11, when
Myrtilus is said to have been thrown overboard ; but some
rationalist has substituted the ship for the car. The introduction

Γεραιστίαις Ι ποντίων σάλων Ι ᾐόσιν ἁρματεύσας. The text, which has not always been
understood, should be thus explained : ' Ever since P. in his four-horsed car guided
across the waves the swift course of his winged steeds,' etc. Even Weil, right in
other respects, misconceives the object of the journey. The winged car was originally,
as we have seen, sufficient in itself to save Pelops : Ares was no match for Poseidon
on the sea. But the introduction of Myrtilus obscured the reason for the traditional
belief that Pelops had crossed the sea in his chariot. Hence other reasons for
a sea-journey were invented and clumsily added to the revised legend. Still later,
the existence of the magical powers was forgotten or discredited (see e. g. Palaeph. 30).

his occasional appearance as a sun-god 1. At an rate the

may be seen from Hom. Σ 402.</p>
<p>The Oenomaus was one of the most successful plays of
Sophocles, as may be gathered from the fact that it was still
acted at the rural Dionysia in the middle of the fourth century,
when Aeschines the orator appeared in the title-role. Hence
Dem. 18. 180 ὃν ἐν Κολλυτῷ ποτ' Οἰνόμαον κακῶς ἐπέτριψας,
242 αὐτοτραγικὸς πίθηκος, ἀρουραῖος Οἰνόμαος. From Hesych. I
p. 287 we learn that the play was the Oenomaus of Sophocles :
ἀρουραῖος Οἰνόμαος· Δημοσθένης Αἰσχίνην οὕτως ἔφη, ἐπεὶ κατὰ
τὴν χώραν περινοστῶν ὑπεκρίνετο Σοφοκλέους τὸν Οἰνόμαον. In
the anonymous Life of Aeschines βιογp. p. 269, 26) we are told
on the authority of Demochares the nephew of Demosthenes,
whose credibility is said to be open to doubt, that, when taking
the part of Oenomaus pursuing Pelops, he fell down in a ridiculous
manner, and was lifted to his feet by Sannio the choirmaster.
From this it has been reasonably inferred by Ribbeck2
that the start of the race was actually represented in the
orchestra.</p>

(Studien zum gr. Perf., Göttingen,

on the ground that in older Greek
τέτοκα is not used as a perfect of result,
but means either (1) ’to have been delivered
of' a child, as in Hdt. 1. 112 ; or
(2) ' to be a mother,' as in Hes. Op. 591.

stringent.

thinks the same matter is referred to in
Accius Oetiotn. fr. V horrida honestitudo
Europae principum primo ex loco. Sophocles
appears to be the only authority
who asserts that Oenomaus scalped his
daughter's suitors : ' shorn for a napkin
in the Scythian fashion ’ ; and we shall
probably not be wrong in adding this to
the list of cases where he has introduced
into his plays an episode or an allusion
borrowed from his reading of Herodotus
(see on fr. 29). Herod. 4. 64 describes
how the Scythian warrior brings home
the heads of all whom he has slain in
battle, and how he scalps them and
treats the skin : ὀργάσας δὲ αὐτὸ ἅτε
χειρόμακτρον ἔκτηται, ἐΚ δὲ τῶν χαλινῶν
τοῦ ἵππου, τὸν αὐτὸς ἐλαύνει, ἐκ
τούτου ἐξάπτει καὶ ἀγάλλεται· ὃς γὰρ
πλεῖστα δέρματα χειρόμακτρα ἔχῃ, ἀνὴρ
αριστος ουτος κεκριται.</p>
<p>Hervverden, relying on Hesych. l.c.,
proposed ἐκδεδαρμένος for ἐκκεκαρμένος,
and his conjecture has been accepted by
Nauck and Blaydes. But this is to
reduce to prose the subtle word-play of
the text, which with a grim irony suggests
that the victim has been skoni ; for the
form of expression certainly recalls Ar.
Thesm. 838 σκάφιον ἀποκεκαρμένην, Αν.
806 σὺ δὲ κοψίχῳ γε σκάφιον ἀποτετιλμένῳ,
— the ' Scythian towel ’ tonsure in place
of the ’Bowl.’ So Ach. 849 Κρατῖνος
εὖ κεκαρμένος μοιχόν. For the ace. after
the pass. part, corresponding to the
object of the active verb see Jebb on
Track. 157. Here the construction implies
that a second accusative (of result)
might have been attached to κείρω when
used in the active with a personal object,
much in the same way as κατατέμνω etc.
are followed by a double ace. (Kuehner-
Gerth i 323, Starkie on Ar. Ach. 302).

1 f. See cr. n. For λύγγα Erfurdt
substituted λίγγα, and Schneider appears
to have been the first to suggest that the
Hesychian gloss (ill p. 52) λύγξ· τὸ τόξον
was an error for λίγξ (Lobeck, Paralip.
Ρ. 110). In Hom. Δ 125 λίγξε βιός
λίζω or λίγγω) is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον for
' the bow twanged.' J. writes : ' As to
ἴυγγα, the ἴυγξ, or wryneck, called in
Greek from its cry ἰύζω), is constantly
mentioned as a love-charm. It was
bound on a wheel, and the revolution of
the wheel was supposed to draw men's
hearts with it. Pind. Nem. 4. 35 ἴυγγι
δ’ ἕλκομαι ἦτορ, "by a charm."
Simaetha, the witch, Theocr. 2. 17 ἴυγξ,

1109 τῇ σῇ ληφθέντες ἴυγγι (“
charm," or " spell"), where ῖ is short, as
ἰύζω has ῖ in Track. 787 ῖ in Theocr., as
ἰύζω has ῖ in Hom. and Pind.). Here, if
λίγγα had better authority, it would be
much better than ἴυγγα, since, as ἀστραπήν
suggests, the idea of an arrow, a glance
darted from the eye, would be more
appropriate than that of the ἴυγξ : cp.
Aesch. Ag. 742 μαλθακὸν ὀμμάτων βίλος,
δηξίρυμον ἔρωτος ἄνθος, suppl. 1004 ὄμματος
θελκτήριον Ι τόξευμ’ ἔπεμψεν, ἱμέρου νικώμενος.'
I have discussed and illustrated the
phraseology which is applied to lover's
glances in C. R. XXIII 255 ff., where this
passage is cited. Add Track. 548. J.
might have found support for his suggestion
— in view of drjpaTrjpiap — from Aesch.
Ag. 1193 ἥματρον, ἢ θηρῶ
τις ὥς; But, apart from the obscurity
λίγξ and the extreme awkwardness of
retaining ἐν ὄψει together with
the objection raised to ἴυγγα ignores
the range of its metaphorical usage,
which the passages quoted from Pindar
and Aristophanes (amongst others) attest.
And the special aptness of ἴυγξ to the
gaze of the lover is proved by Heliod.
8. 5 μεγάλην εἰς περθὼ κέκτηται πρὸς
ἄνδρας ἴυγγα τὰ γυναικεῖα καὶ σύνοικα
βλέμματα, and by Lycophr. 310 πυρφόρῳ
βαλὼν ἴυγγι τόξων — the charm of Troilus
for Achilles — where ἴυγγι is fantastically
joined to τόξων. I have, therefore, no
hesitation in accepting (with Nauck)
Valckeaer's brilliant emendation. —
ἀστραπήν expresses a familiar metaphor :
Achill. Tat. 6. 6. ἰδὼν δ’ ὁ Θέρσανδρος τὸ
κάλλος ἐΚ παραδρομῆς, ὡς ἀρπαζομένης
ἀστραπῆς, μάλιστα γὰρ ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς
κάθηται τὸ κάλλος κτἑ. Heliod. 1. 21
πλέον ἢ πρότερον αὐτὸν τῷ κάλλει
(so often in the Erotici), Pind.

The application is different in
Ar. Ach. 566 ἀστραπὰς βλέπων.</p>
<p>3 The metaphorical use of καίεσθαι,
θερμαίνεσθαι, uro, ardeo and the like is
too common to require illustration. For
θάλπεσθαι cf. Aesch. Prom. 615, 677

<p>4 f. Translate : ' Scanning with responsive
vision as closely as the craftsman's
straight-drawn plumb-line clings
to its level,' i.e. letting his glance go
straight to meet mine, no less directly
than the κανών draws its line. The fiery
flash is a physical emanation from the
eye, which, making its way straight to
the eye of the beloved, is met in its course
by the responsive glance of mutual love
speeding as fast to the eye of the lover.
Cf. Heliod. 3. 7 ἠ τῶν ἐρώτων γένεσις,
οἷς τὰ ὁρώμενα τὴν ἀρχῂω δίδωσι καὶ

ἠδονῆς ἀλγηδόνι μεμιγμένης. J.'s explanation
is slightly different: ‘ "
an equal glance," — i.e. " responding with
measured glance to mine." The glance
of Pelops is ardent, but discreetly
observes the limit which her glance prescribes.'
But the idea of restraint is alien
to the passage ; the intention is to emphasize
the exact correspondence of their
passionate glances. — ὥστε, as, is commonly
employed in Homer to introduce
a simile (Monro, H.G.2 § 285. 3. a.);
but is very seldom found in Attic poetry
with a finite verb following : cf. Aesch.
fr. 39 ὥστε διπλόοι Ι λύκοι νεβρὸν φέρουσιν
ἀμφὶ μασχάλαις. Soph. fr. 840 μολυβδὶς
ὥστε δίΚτυον κατέσπασεν. Track. 11 2
699. Tyrrell on Eur. Bacch. 1066.
Rhes. 972. These are the last echoes
of the Homeric idiom. —στάθμη, ' is
’ says J., ’(a piece of string, on
which chalk or ochre is rubbed), drawn
tight from point to point. κανών (regula)
is the carpenter's rule: Ar. Αυ. 1004
ὀρθῷ μετρήσω κανόνι προστιθείς.
simile would fit, if the meaning were
that the carpenter is drawing or testing
with his κανών a line parallel to the line
traced by the στάθμη. Hippodamia's
glance is the στάθμη: that of Pelops is
the Κανών, which keeps its due distance
all along.' But στάθμη and κανών are
not always so distinguished, and they
are actually identified by the schol. on
Homer's ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν. See also
Eustath. Od. p. 1531, 62 and other
passages quoted on fr. 330. Here, at
least, I think there is little doubt that
κανών is the ruddled string (or rule), as in
Eur. Her. 945 Φοίνικι κανόνι, and στάθμη
the line to be drawn on the material.
The significance of the comparison is
enhanced by the fact that the carpenter's
eye is engaged in finding the exact
measurement : Lucian Icaromenipp. 14
ἐπεὶ Καὶ τοὺς τέκτονας πολλάκις ἑωρακέναι
μοι δοκῶ θατέρῳ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἄμεινον
πρὸς τοὺς κανόνας ἀπευθύνοντας τὰ ξύλα,
Pers. 1. 66 oculo rubricam dirigat uno.
Thus, παρὰ στάθην (ad amussim) is
absolutely straight: see Wecklein on
Aesch. Ag. 1029 ὠμοί τε δούλοις πάντα
Καὶ παγὰ στάθμην ('rigorously exact').
Tr. fr. adesp. 287 ἀκριβὲς οἰάκισμα πρὸς
στάθμην βίου. Theocr. 25. 194 κατὰ
στάθμην ἀνόησας. Eur. Ion 1514 παρ’
οἵαν ἤλθoμεν στάθμην βίου has been well
explained by Bayfield. It follows that,
there is no antithesis here between στάθμη
and κανών as separate implements for
measuring. Purser in Dict. Ant. 1 354 a
takes a different view : ’ The carpenter
used to correct errors in the κανών by the
aid of his eye and the στάθμη.' This is
as if the θανών itself needed adjustment,
— a contradiction in terms (cf. Dio Chrys.
62. 7). See also Dict. Ant. 11 373b, 541b ;
and Tyrrell on Eur, Tro. 6. The soundness
of ἰόντος (cr. n.) — ’passing along
the line ’ — is established by Theogn. 945

<p>2f. ἀμποταθείην is the certain corretion
of Shilleto (in Holden's Aristoph.
p. 582 [1848]): it was restored inde

For the optative cf. Ai. 1217 ff. γενοίμαν
τὰς ἱερὰς ὅπως προσείποιμεν Ἀθάνας
(Jebb's n.). —ἀτρυγέτου must go with
λίμανς, which thus stands in a double
relation to the context, unless we prefer
to say that it is supplied a second lime
with olbfia. For similar examples see
Kuehner-Gerth ii 564 f. It is impos-
sible to supply πόντου with Campbell
or ἁλός with Rogers al., or to render
’ over the barren wilderness ’ with Hartung,
as if γαίας or ὄρους were suppressed.
And, as against the latter view,
it may be added that Sophocles would
not have employed the Homeric ἀτρύγετος,
for which see Allen and Sikes on
h. Dem. 67, in a non-Homeric relation.
Nauck adopts Kock's ὑπὲρ &#x003C;αἰθέρος&#x003E;
ἀτρυγέτου, but ὑπὲρ αἰθέρος should at
least be justified and seems impossible
here. Translate therefore: ’above the
barren waters, skimming the grey seasurge.'

Arcesilaus used these lines to

τόκος, which was intended to signify
' interest ’ ; and the innuendo was that
the respondent was keener in business
than in the pursuit of truth. From
Diogenes Laertius the quotation passed
to Suid. s.v. διέξοδοι, and Zonar. s.v.
διέξοδος, p. 517. Plut. quaest. conu. 8. 1.
5 p. 718 A quotes the lines, without mentioning
author or play, and with the
variants stated above, to illustrate the
impregnation of a mortal creature by
divine agency.</p>
<p>1 f. λήθουσι κτἑ. : ' For the hen is
not ware of the passage of the winds
(through her body), save when broodingtime
is at hand.' The correctness of
λήθουσι as against πλήθουσι, which is
given by the Mss οf Plutarch, is established
by Gomperz, Nachlese, pp. pp. 7 — 10.
He points out that the earliest example
of πλήθω with transitive force πληροῦσι
conj. Blaydes) is in a votive epigram from
Cyzicus belonging to the first century B.C.
(Kaibel, 874 a). Moreover, if πλήθουσι
is read, no intelligible sense can be elicited
from the passage, so that Duebner was
led to the assumption of a lacuna after
V. 2. The fact that Plutarch does not
give the source of his reference diminishes
the weight otherwise due to his authority,
and makes it not unlikely that he is
quoting from memory. At the same
time, it is quite possible that the error
is due to his transcribers, and I cannot
agree with Gomperz that the appearance
of ὑποπίμπλησι in the context proves that
πλήθουσι came from Plutarch himself.
— It seems most likely that Sophocles
alludes to the fable of the wind-egg (Ar.
Αν. 695 τίκτει πρώτιστον ὑπηνέμιον Νὺξ ἡ
μελανόπτερος ᾠόν), as explained by Arist.
de gen. an. 3. 1. 749a 34, hist. an. 6. 2.
560a 6, ζεφύρια δὲ καλεῖται τὰ ὑπηνέμια
ὑπό τινων, ὅτι ὑπὸ τὴν ἐαρινὴν ὥραν
δεχόμεναι τὰ πνεύματα αἰ ὄρνιθες.
Gomperz, however, points out that
the exact character of the reference is
uncertain, and that the poet may have
been thinking of the impregnation of the
partridge: Arist. hist. an. 5. 5. 541a 26
αἱ δὲ πέρδικες ἂν κατὰ ἄνεμον στῶσιν
θήλειαι τῶν ἀρρένων, ἔγκυοι γίνονται.
Plin. n. h. 10. 33. 102 si contra mares
steterint feminae, aura ab his Jlante praegneantes
fiunt. Similar tales were current
(1) with reference to the sagacity of ewes :
Aelian nat. an. 7. 27 τά γε μὴν πρόβατα
κἀκεῖνο οἶδεν, ὅτι αὐτοῖς ὀ βορρᾶς Καὶ
νότος συμμάχονται πρὸς τὸ τίκτειν οὐ μεῖον
τῶν ἀναβαινόντων αὐτὰ κριῶν κτἑ. (2)
the impregnation of mares by the west
wind : Verg. G. 3. 272 ff. vere magis, quia
vere calor redit ossibus, illae Ι ore omnes
versae in Zephyrum stant rupibus altis, Ι
exceptantque levis auras, et saepe sine
ullis Ι coniugiis vento gravidae (with
Conington's note). —διέξοδοι can hardly
mean ’currents (directions),' as J. suggested;
usage requires the rendering
given above. Of. Plat. Tim. 91 C τὰς
τοῦ πνεύματος διεξόδους ἀποφράττον. For
this reason it is impossible to accept his
proposal to give the words a larger mean-
ing, excluding the special reference to
ὑπηνέμια : ' A female bird knows, by the
west wind, when the spring has come,
and with it the brooding-season.' The
general purpose of the image is to illustrate
the axiom, that men give very little
heed to many obvious facts, so long as
their own interests are not involved. —
irXijv. Blaydes suggests the addition
of γ᾿.</p>
<p>ΠΑΛΑΜΗΛΗΣ</p>
<p>The epitome of Proclus records (EGF p. 20) the fact that the
death of Palamedes was related in the Cypria, but gives no
details. Fortunately, however, Pausanias states (10. 31. 2) that
he had himself read in the cypria that Palamedes was drowned
on a fishing expedition, and that Diomedes and Odysseus were
his murderers. This version does not appear to have been followed
by any other extant authority, and it is generally assumed that all
the tragedians adopted an alternative account according to which
Palamedes was falsely accused of treason by Odysseus. The
story, which is most fully recounted by Hyginus (fab. 105), relates

<pb n="132"/>
how Odysseus plotted revenge against Palamedes for having
outwitted him (see p. 115)1. He sent a message to
that he had been warned in a dream that the site of the camp
should be moved for a single day. Agamemnon gave orders for
this to be done, and Odysseus then buried a considerable quantity
of gold by night on the spot where the tent of Palamedes stood.
He also composed a letter which he gave to a Phrygian prisoner
to be conveyed to Priam, and instructed one of his soldiers to
intercept him at a short distance from the camp and to kill him.
On the following day, when the army had returned, a soldier
brought in the forged letter, which he had found on the Phrygian's
corpse. The letter purported to be written by Priam to
Palamedes, and to promise him the exact amount of gold which
Odysseus had buried, if he would betray the camp of Agamemnon
according to his engagement. Palamedes denied his guilt, but
was convicted on the discovery of the buried gold, and put to
death by the whole army. Some of these details are varied by
the scholiast on Eur. Or. 432, where Agamemnon and Diomedes
are the accomplices of Odysseus, a Phrygian captive with gold
in his possession is compelled to forge the letter and is then slain,
and a slave of Palamedes is bribed to place the letter and the
gold under the bed of his master. Apollodorus (epit. 6. 8) clearly
did not follow the Cypria at this point ; for he relates that Palamedes
medes stoned 2 to death in consequence of the plot concerted
by Odysseus with Agamemnon. That the treason-story was
current in tragedy is proved by Polyaen. 1 prooein. 12 οἷον δὲ
κἀκεῖνο στρατήγημα Ὀδυσσέως οἱ τραγῳδοὶ ᾄδουσι.
ἐνίΚησεν Ὀδυσσεὺς ἐν δικαστηρίῳ τῶν Ἀχαιῶν ὑποβαλὼν αὐτοῦ
τῇ σκηνῇ βαρβαρικὸν χρυσίον, καὶ ὁ σοφώτατος τῶν Ἑλλήνων
ἐκεῖνος ἥλω προδοσίας. And in Plat. rep. 522 D the appearance
of Palamedes ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις is connected with a speech which
he seems to have made in his own defence. At any rate a speech
of this kind probably occurred in the Palamedes of Aeschylus (fr.
182), as well as in the play of Euripides bearing the same name
(fr. 578). It is noteworthy that the corresponding fragments in
Sophocles (frs. 479 and 432) are in the third person and that
fr. 432 was part of a speech by Nauplius. Thinking that
Nauplius could not have been a character in the present play
Brunck, followed by Dindorf, assigned both of these passages to
the Nauplius (frs. 379, 380 D.). But that is impossible ; for the
<note type="footnote">1 Ahrens lays stress on Vergil's quia bella vetabat (Aen. 2. 83), but we have no
reason to connect this detail with Sophocles. The version of Uictys (2. Ι5) that
Palamedes was induced to descend into a well and then buried beneath a mass of
stones is certainly not tragic.</note>

<pb n="133"/>
authority which ascribes fr. 479 to the Palamedes should not be
questioned, whether it was that of Polemo or another. It is not
so clear that Vater1 was right in assigning fr. 432 also to the
Palamedes ; but the recurrence of οὗτος and ἀφηῦρε, as well as
the general similarity of the two passages, suggests that they
both belonged to the same speech. It is, moreover, certain that
Nauplius appeared in the play of Aeschylus : fr. 1 8 1 τίνος κατέκτας
ἕνεκα παῖδ' ἐμὸν βλάβης2. In that case we must assume
that Nauplius came to Troy after his son's death to exact retribution,
but failed in his attempt owing to the influence of
Agamemnon, as is stated by Apollod. erit. 6. 8 and schol. Eur.
Or. 432 3. Welcker referred frs. 480 and 481 to the same speech.
He also assigned to this play frs. 843, 855, 913, but none of them
with much probability.</p>

Od. p. 1397, 9 from the Palamedes of
Sophocles on the authority of ὁ τὰ περὶ
Ἐλληνικῆς παιδᾶς γράψας. The lastnamed
work was written by Suetonius
(c. 100 A.D.): see Μ. Schanz, öm. Litt.
Ill p. 48. The authority of Eustathius
is, therefore, amply sufficient of refute
the opinion of Brunck, approved by
Dindorf, that these verses are to be
assigned to the Nauplius.
The verses appear to have been spoken
either by the advocate of Palamedes, or
by Nauplius, who, according to Vater's
conjecture, arrived at the close of the
play : see on fr. 432 and the Introductory
Note. Welcker's View that they are the
words of Palamedes himself is improbable.</p>
<p>1 f. λιμόν. There was a tradition
of a famine while the fleet was delayed at
Aulis (Aesch. Ag. 203 πνοαὶ. . .νήστιδες),
and that the inventiveness of Palamedes
was of assistance in relieving the distress
(schol. Eur. Or. 432). It is not clear,
however, whether that is the occasion to
which Sophocles here alludes. ' When
the Greek army were suffering from
famine, they were relieved by the Οἰνοτρόποι
of Delos, the daughters of Anius,
Οἰνώ, Σπερμώ and Ἐλαΐς, who
the gift of creating corn and wine and oil :
this was one of the incidents related in
the Cypria (EGF p. 29). According to
Lycophron (and the schol. and Eust. Il.
p. 827, 44 referring to him) the famine was
at Troy: 581 at Καὶ στρατοῦ βούπειναν. . .
ἀλθανοῦσιν ἐλθοῦσαί ποτε Ι Σίθωνος εἰς
θυγατρὸς εὐναστήριον, i.e. to Ροίτειον.
In Apollod. epit. 3. 10 their powers are
briefly mentioned after Palamedes' death.'
[But nothing can be inferred from this,
as the narrative immediately afterwards
passes to the events at Aulis, and the
death of Palamedes is clearly mentioned
out of its proper sequence] ' Tzetzes
on Lycophr. 581 records that Agamemnon
sent for them by means of Palamedes :
Ἀγαμέμνων, τῶν Ἑλλήνων λιμῷ συνεχομένων,
μετεπέμψατο τὰς Οἰνοτρόπους διὰ
τοῦ Παλαμήδους, καὶ ἐλθοῦσαι εἰς τὸ
Ῥοίτειον ἔτρεφον αὐτούς.’ (H.)</p>
<p>Pherecydes related that Anius urged
the Greeks to stay with him at Delos
until the tenth year, when it was fated
for Troy to fall, and promised that in the
meantime his daughters would provide
the necessary supplies (FHG 1 94).
Immisch maintained (Rh. Mus. XLIV
301 ff.) against Welcker (F.p. Cycl. 11
107) that the stay at Delos, as well as the
allusion to the Οἰνοτρόποι, was included
in the narrative of the Cypria, and that it
occurred immediately after the first start
from Aulis : see Gruppe, Gr. Myth.
p. 6685. According to schol. Hom.
ζ 164 Simonides (fr. 24 : ἐν ταῖς κατευχαῖς)
represented Odysseus and Menelaus as
sent to Delos in order to fetch the
daughters of Anius to Troy. We should
expect Sophocles to follow the version of
the Cypria, but it is uncertain whether it
contained the fetching of the Οἰνοτρόποι
by Palamedes. —ἔπανσε should be preferred
to ἀπῶσε, for which Sophocles
would have substituted dveuxre: see
Cobet, Coll. Crit. p. 35. In Thuc. 2.
84 modern texts have διεωθοῦντο. — σὺν
θεῷ εἰπεῖν, ' with reverence be it spoken.'
σὺν θεῷ and σὺν θεοῖς are generally anarthrous
when thus used: but see Jebb on
Ai. 383, and cp. Ar. Ran. 1199. For
the phrase cf. Eur. Med. 625 ἴσως γάρ,
σὺν θεῷ δ’ εἰρήσεται, Ι γαμεῖς τοιοῦτον
ὥστε σ’ ἀρνεῖσθαι γάμον, Ar. Plut. 114
οἶμαι γὰρ οἶμαι, σὺν θεῷ δ’ εἰρήσεται,
ταύτης ἀπαλλάξειν σε τῆς ἀφθαλμέας (paratragoedic).
σὺν θεῷεἰπεῖν occurs in Plat.
Prot. 3176, Theaet. 151 B and elsewhere.</p>
<p>3 φλοίσβου: ' battle-din. Hom. E 322
etc.' (J.). If the discovery took place at
Aulis, it would refer to the storm which
prevented the fleet from sailing. In
a recent discussion of the word (Class.
Phil. V 328) Sturtevant suggests that it
means ' wave, surge,' rather than ' roar,'
and that ' after buffeting the waves wanes' is
the natural rendering of this passage.</p>

<p>This obscure statement seems to imply
that Sophocles used a verbal adjective
SpoTTos with the meaning 'plucked.' Such
a formation is not easily supported by
analogy : we have τομός (beside τόμος),
but with the active meaning; in compounds,
where the accent shifts, it is more
common, as in μετάπροπος, πολύτροπος,
ἐπίσκοπος, εὔσκοπος, ὁδοιπόρος. Nor is the
existence of δροπός proved by Etym. Μ.
191, 53 βίοτος· ἡ ἄκανθα ὡς παρὰ τὸ κυρτός
κύρτος. . .οὕτω βατός (qu. &#x003C;παρὰ τὸ&#x003E;
βατός) βάτος, καὶ παρὰ τὸ δρέπω δρόπος,
καὶ βατοδρόπος (Hom. h. Herm. 190).
Here analogy seems to suggest δρομάς,
but the accentuation is probably due to
the fact that the whole clause is merely
intended as an analysis and explanatiou
of the compound βατοδρόπος. Hence Μ.
Schmidt's view, to which Nauck inclines,
that δροπά is the remnant of some compound
such as ὠμόδροπα or ἀρτίδροπα
(read as ἄρτι δροπά), is plausible. Blomfield
(on Aesch. Theb. 324) suggested
ἄδροπα· ἄδρεπτα. On the other hand,
W. Dindorf advocated δρωπτά (or, as he
seems afterwards to have preferred,
δρωπά)· δρεπτά from Suid. s.v. δρωπακίζω·
συνάγω, τρυγῶ. δρωπτὰ (al. δρωπά,
and so Zonar. p. 572) γὰρ τὸ δρεπτά.
x003E; τὰ δρέπανα. ' δρωπτά would presuppose
a verb δρώπω or δρώφω; more
probable than this would be δρυπτά
(from δρύφω = δρύπτω), which should be
restored in Galen gloss. Hippocr. XIX 94
δερπτά (or δραπτά)· ἐσπαραγμένα, for
σπαράσσειν was used in explanation of
δρύπτειν, but not of δρέπειν' (H.).</p>
<p>Welcker guessed that this and the preceding
fragment referred to the contronersy
between Palamedes and Odysseus
as to the ravages of a flock of wolves,
which Palamedes interpreted as a sign of
the coming plague, recommending the
army to adopt a vegetable diet : see
Philostr. her. 11. 5.</p>
<p>ΠΑΝΔΩΡΑ Η ΣΦΥΡΟΚΟΠΟΙ</p>
<p>It is supposed, no doubt rightly, that the subject of this satyrplay
was the making of the first woman 1, Pandora, and the result
for mankind of her arrival. The myth is related in Hes. Op. —
105, and less completely in Theog. 570 — 589. Zeus determined
to punish men in retribution for the deceit practised by . Prometheus
in their favour, when he stole and gave to them the
fire which the king of the gods withheld (cf Theog. 563). So he
<note type="footnote">1 Hesiod does not definitely say that Pandora was the first woman, but most
modern authorities agree with Pausanias (i. 24. 7) that such was his intention.
Goettling-Flach, however, on Hes. Op. 47 contend that the allegory figures a change
for the worse in woman's character.</note>

<pb n="136"/>
bade Hephaestus to mix earth with water, and to fashion thereout
a lovely maiden of divine beauty with human voice and strength ;
Athena to teach her woman's handicraft ; Aphrodite to endow
her with every grace and charm that should compel men's love ;
and Hermes to give her shamelessness and deceit. The work of
Hephaestus is perhaps referred to in fr. 482. When the woman
was thus completely fashioned, she received the name Pandora,
because all the Olympians had made her each a gift. Then
Zeus ordered Hermes to conduct her and present her to Epimetheus,
who, though he had been warned by Prometheus never
to accept a gift from Zeus, lest it should be fraught with evil for
mankind, disregarded the advice, and discovered his mistake
when it was too late. For up to that time men had lived without
any form of toil or disease ; but the woman, on her arrival,
opened the lid of the jar in which all these evils were concealed,
and, before she could shut it down again, they all made their
escape, and ever since have been wandering over the earth,
bringing evil to whomsoever they come. Only Hope remained
behind in the jar, when Pandora closed it again.</p>
<p>The title indicates that the satyrs in the play appeared as
Hammerers, and we must infer that they acted as assistants in
the workshop of Hephaestus, while he was engaged in shaping
Pandora. The connexion of satyrs with Hephaestus has already
been noticed in the Daedalus (l p. 110) and the Cedalion (11.
p. 9) ; but there is further evidence of their employment as
his workmen. Proclus in his commentary on Hesiod says :
Μιν ὅτι Προμηθεὺς τὸν τοῦ κακοῦ πίθον παρὰ τῶν σατύρων
λαβὼν καὶ παραθέμενος τῷ Ἐπμηθεῖ, παρήγγειλε τὴν Πανδώραν
μὴ δέξασθαι (on Op. 94). Is it rash to conjecture that the
authority whom Proclus followed was explaining the text of
Hesiod by reference to the play of Sophocles ? Otherwise it is
difficult to understand whence he derived the allusion to the
satyrs. In two epigrams of the Anthology (adesp. 412, 413
Jacobs) satyrs are described as chained by the feet and working
in the smithy of Hephaestus in order to earn their living. In
the former of these the forging of the arms of Achilles is mentioned
as one of their tasks, and Jacobs conjectured that the
work of art which provided the opportunity of the epigrammatist
was a representation of some scene from a satyric drama, giving
as possible originals the Myrmidons of Aeschylus 1, and the
Ἀχιλλέως ἐρασταί of Sophocles. But the reference to the
armour of Achilles should not prevent us from observing
that a plausible reconstruction of fr. 486 is favoured by the words
<note type="footnote">1 But the Myrmidons was not a satyr-play.</note>

<pb n="137"/>
διχθάδιον κατὰ κῶλον ἀλυκτοπέδῃσι λυγωθείς and ποδίκροτον
ἅμμα καθάψας in the epigrams.</p>
<p>The word σφυροκόποι may be illustrated by the design reproduced
from a lekythos in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris
by Miss J. E. Harrison in J. H. S. XX 106 1, where two men (not
satyrs), armed with large mallets, are represented hammering
the colossal had of a woman. The head is not identified as
belonging to Pandora, but that identification is supported by the
painting on an amphora in the Ashmolean Museum reproduced
by Prof. P. Gardner in J. H. S. XXI I ff. Here, however, it is
Epimetheus who carries a mallet and gazes at Pandora represented
either as rising from the ground or as an incomplete
statue. It is possible that the last-mentioned design follows
a non-Hesiodic form of the myth, according to which Epimetheus
modelled his wife out of clay 2; but there is no evidence of any
such variant. Miss Harrison, however, undertook to show ( J. H.
S. XX 99) that the main subject of the play was the birth of
Pandora and not the opening of her jar. For this purpose she
emphasized the association of Pandora with the earth-goddess
(schol. Ar. Au. 971), and brought her πίθος into connexion with
the πιθοιγία and the release of malevolent κῆρες 3. More recently
Robert has manitained 4 that the satyr-chorus consisted not of
hammerers engaged in fashioning σφυρήλατα, but of clodbreakers
who assisted Epimetheus in freeing Pandora from the
earth ; that. fr. 482 refers not to the modelling of Pandora, but
to the making of a woman by Prometheus under her directions ;
and that the designs on a lost amphora figured as no. 71 in
Miss ’s Prolegomena (p. 280) are to be interpreted in
the above sense.</p>
<p>Even if we admit the possible ambiguity of σφυροκόποι,
the considerations adduced seem insufficient to oust the probability
that Sophocles followed in the main the Hesiodic tradition,
with such modifications as might be necessary to adapt it to
the conditions of a satyr-play. Moreover, the fashioning by
Prometheus of the first mortals out of clay, though combined
by the mythographers 5 with the story of Pandora, was represented
by them as antecedent to her arrival.
The difficulties involved in the Hesiodic account, and the
origin of the version which made the πίθος full of blessings
rather than of evils 6, cannot be discussed here.</p>

<p>The grammarians (so also Suid., Etym.

βλίσσω (fr. 778) ; but, so far as we can
tell, they hav nothing in common. However
this may be, Schneidewin was
certainly wrong in supposing that the
reference quoted above belongs to fr. 778 ;
for Erotian was not concerned to illustrate
the use of βλίσσω, and βλιμάζειν,
employed as a vox amatoria, was obviously
suitable to the subject of the

L. and S. require correction, for there
can be no doubt on the above evidence
that χήλευμα meant an awl. The interpretation
‘ netted work, a cord ’ was
due to the false reading σπαρτίον in
Hesychius. Dindorf conjectured that the
lemma of Hesychius should be read as
κεχήλευμαι πόδας, and that this was a
tragic phrase taken either from Aeschylus
or Sophocles (adesp. 220 Ν.). Wecklein
in Berl. phil. Woch. 1890, 656 went
further, holding that κεχήλευμαι πόδας and
not χήλευμα is the quotation attributed
to the Pandora. So also Bapp in Roscher
III 3064. This view, which is possibly
right (see p. 136), had already been anticipated
by Ellendt ; but the presumption
is rather the other way. — There is not
sufficient evidence to distinguish χηλόω
and χηλεύω.</p>

<p>ΠΗΛΕΥΣ</p>
<p>Fr. 487 shows that the subject of the play was the fortunes
of Peleus in his old age. It cannot therefore have dealt with
his purification by Acastus, the lying accusation of the disappointed
Astydamia, or the escape of Peleus from his peril on
Mt Pelion, although Ar. Nub. 1063 probably indicates that the
’earlier adventures had been represented on the tragic stage. It
is possible that Aristophanes was referring to the Peleus of
Euripides 1, unless fr. 619 should be held to warrant a different
conclusion. The well-known reference in Hor. in Hor. A. P. 95 (et
tragicus plerumque dolet seinnone pedestri | Telephus et Peleus,
cum pauper et exul uterque | proicit ampullas et sesquipedalia
verba) cannot be attributed with certainty to any one period of
’s chequered career ; but most readers of Horace have
supposed that he was thinking of the exile twice suffered by
Peleus in consequence of the deaths of Phocus and Eurytion.</p>
<p>In Hom. Σ 434 Peleus is said to be worn out by the weight
of years, and in Ω 488 2 and λ 493 3 there are somewhat more
definite allusions to the oppression of Peleus by his neighbours,
and his inability to protect himself against them. In his abstract
of the Cyclic Nosti Proclus states (EGF p. 53) that on the
advice of Thetis Neoptolemus returned from Troy by land;
that in passing through Thrace he found Odysseus in Maronea ;
and that he completed the rest of his journey and buried Phoenix
when he died. Then follow the words, αὐτὸς δὲ εἰς Μολοσσοὺς
ἀφικόμενος ἀναγνωρίζεται Ηηλεῖ. The clumsiness of the epito9mator
is sufficiently obvious, but his words certainly seem to
imply that the meeting of Neoptolemus with Peleus took place
in Molossia. Yet, although there is plenty of evidence to
connect Neoptolemus with ’’, it is not elsewhere recorded
that Peleus removed to that country. That the incidents were
in fact entirely separate appears probable from ApoUod. epit. 6.
12 f, where, after a reference to the settlement of Neoptolemus
in Molossia, it is stated that he succeeded to the sovereignty of
Achilles after the death of Peleus, who had been driven out by
the sons of Acastus. Other evidence makes the inference
certain. Euripides (Tro. 11 26 ff.) says that Neoptolemus has

sailed to Phthia, καινάς τινας | Πηλέως ἀκούσας συμξοράς, ὥς νιν
χθονὸς | Ἄκαστος ἐκβέβληκεν ὁ Πελίου γίνος. On these words
the scholiast comments ; ὁ μὲν Εὐριπίδης ὑπὸ Ἀκάστου φησὶν ἐκβεβλῆσθαι
τὸν Πηλέα· εἰσὶ δὲ οἳ φασὶν 1 ὑπὸ τῶν δύο αὐτοῦ
παίδων, Ἀρχάνδρου καὶ Ἀρχιτέλους, κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν ὂν ἔμελλον
Ἕλληνες ἐξ Ἰλίου ἐπανιέναι, ἐξεληλάσθαι καὶ ἐλθόντα εἰς ἀπαντησιν
τῷ Νεοπτολέμῳ προσελθεῖν διὰ Χειμῶνα τῇ κῷ τῇ νήσῳ
καὶ ζενισθέντα ὑπὸ Μόλωνός τινος Ἄβαντος ἐκεῖ καταλύσασθαι
τὸν βίον. We seem to require here an alteration in order that
προσελθεῖν may be referred to Neoptolemus instead of
Peleus, as will presently appear from the fuller account of
Dictys. The schol. Townl. on Horn. 12 488 explains : λέγει δὲ
Ἄκαστον καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἄρχανδρον καὶ Ἀρχετελην. The
mention of Archander and Architeles introduces an element of
confusion, since elsewhere they were called sons of Achaeus,
whereas the sons of Acastus are known as Menalippus and
Pleisthenes. Consequently TiimpeP would substitute Ἀχαιοῦ
for Ἀκάστου in both places. The question is of subsidiary
importance for the present purpose ; and we may infer from
Euripides that Acastus and not Achaeus must have been the
traditional enemy of Peleus. The schol. on Pind. Pyth. 3. 167
appeals to the authority of Callimachus (fr. 372) for the vague
and probably corrupt statement ὁ δὲ Πηλεὺς ἐν Ἰκῷ τῇ νήσῳ
ἀτυχήσας τὸν βίον οἰκτρῶς καὶ ἐπωδύνως ἀπέθανεν. So Drachmann
reads, with ἐν Ἰκῷ from several MSS for ἐν Κῷ 3. Icus was
a small island east of Magnesia and north of Euboea (Strabo
436). It is obvious that τῇ Ἰκῷ should also be restored in schol.
Eur., and the difficulty of explaining the removal of Peleus to
Cos at once disappears. This brings us to the detailed narrative
of Dictys (6. 7 — 9), which has with reason been suspected of
coming from a tragic source. Neoptolemus, while repairing his
storm-tossed ships in Molossia, learnt that Peleus had been
driven out by Acastus. Desirous of avenging his grandsire's
wrongs, he sent two of his companions to Thessaly, who returned
with a full report of the treachery of Acastus. Neoptolemus
at once put to sea, although the weather was unfavourable,
and was wrecked on the Sepiades — the rock-bound coast of
Magnesia 4 — losing all his fleet and most of his men, and himself
escaping with difficulty. Here he found Peleus, who had
concealed himself in a gloomy cavern in order to avoid further

violence from Acastus, but was continually on the watch for seafarers,
in the hope of obtaining news of his grandson. While
he was engaged in preparations for an attack upon Acastus,
Neoptolemus learnt that Menalippus and Pleisthenes, his sons,
had arrived in the neighbourhood on a hunting expedition.
Disguising himself as a native of lolcus, Neoptolemus announced
his own death to the young men, and was subsequently invited
to join their party. Thus he obtained opportunities of killing
them separately, as well as their faithful servant Cinyras, who
arrived with the news that Acastus was on his way to join
them. Neoptolemus then changed his disguise and appeared
before Acastus in Phrygian dress as Mestor the son of Paris,
who had come to Thessaly as a captive of Neoptolemus. Acastus
was informed that Neoptolemus was lying asleep in a cave,
exhausted by his voyage. He accordingly hurried on to the cave
in order to surprise his enemy, but was met at the entrance by
Thetis, who had arrived to visit Peleus. The goddess rebuked
Acastus for his cruelty to the house of Achilles, but persuaded
Neoptolemus to spare his life. Acastus, overjoyed at the unexpected
recovery of his freedom, willingly resigned the sovereignty
to Neoptolemus.</p>
<p>That some authorities should make Icus the scene of Peleus's
exile, and others a cavern in the Sepiades, is only such a variation
as we are accustomed to meet with in the heroic legends. It
would be idle to pretend that there is a strong case in favour of
the contention that the whole of the material in Dictys was
taken from the plot of Sophocles 1. But certain of its features,
such as the appearance of Thetis to compose the feud, are
unmistakably dramatic; and there is no other play which has
so good a claim to be considered its ultimate source as the Peleus
of Sophocles.</p>
<p>Welcker proceeded to identify the Peleus with the Phthiotides,
but his arguments are quite unconvincing, (i) He makes
the unnecessary and unjustifiable assumption that Archander
and Architeles were sons of Peleus by a former marriage, and
that they had driven out and ill-treated their father, who was in
his dotage. The object of this is to work in fr. 696 2. (2) He
strangely supposes that fr. 694 was addressed to Peleus by the
speaker of fr. 487. It is of course possible that Peleus in exile
was visited by a chorus of women from Phthia, but a female
-chorus generally indicates that a woman plays the leading part.
Besides, the proposed identification would compel us to make

a coinage of Soph, after παιδαγωγῶ, repeated
twenty years later in O.C. 348.
In the meantime it caught the fancy of
the comic poets (v. supr.). In the line
quoted by Plut. ἀναμισθαρνεῖν is either
‘ to get pay once ’ i.e. as a dicast,
after having been put on the shelf; or
perhaps refers to a constant succession of
profitable services. —ἀναπαιδεύω πάλιν
is pleonastic, like μεταγνῶναι πάλιν in
Phil. 1270. Logically no doubt a distinction
may be made, in so far as πάλιν
denotes reversion to an eairlier state and
dva- repeated action (Ellendt) ; but this
is to refine too much. So πάλιν αὖθις in
v. 3.</p>

<p>It is quite uncertain, as Nauck remarks,
how much belongs to Sophocles. The
scholiast does not necessarily mean more
than that the word ὁμορροθῶ was used by
Sophocles in the sense of ‘ I ’ as
also in Ant. 536 εἴπερ ἥδ’ ὁμορροθεῖ. The
transference may well have been a neologism,
for Eur. Or. 529 comes much
nearer to the original meaning (κυρίως τὸ
ἅμα Καὶ συμφώνως ἐρέσσειν). But at the
same time we cannot exclude the possibility
that the emphatic repetition of the
notion of assent was the point of the
parody from the Peleus. This is to some
extent confirmed by the frequency with
which ἔχω and the aor. part, are employed
in Sophocles as a periphrasis for the
perfect indicative : see the examples
quoted by Goodw. § 47, Kuehner-Gerth
II 61. The idiom occurs in a chorus at
Ant. 794 σὺ Καὶ τόδε νεῖκος ἀνδρῶν ξύναιμον

fr. 623 There is clearly some error, but
it is impossible to ascertain how it arose.
Wilamowitz (Tr. Gr. fragg. p. 27) thinks
schol. V should be followed, since the
play of Soph, is elsewhere copied by Ar.
and his scholl. The same words are
also quoted in the scholia as occurring in
the Satyri of Phrynichus (fr. 46, I 382 K.),
and there must, it would seem, have been
something in them which tickled the
Attic fancy as expressive of a very loud
cry. Probably ὑπέρτονος suggested the
fortissimo of a musical score : cf. τείνω,
τόνος. Its only appearance elsewhere in
tragedy is as applied to the blast of the
Tyrrhenian trumpet (Aesch. Eum. 572).

Sophocles used μὴ νόμισον as well as μὴ

more probable that the text of the Antiatticist

μὴ νόμισον was originally cited from the

<pb n="146"/>
comic poet Thugenides (fr. 3, 111 377 K.),
in view of the evidence of Photius (lex.

τοῦ μὴ νομίσῃς· οὕτω Θουκθδίδης (Qayevldrjs
Suid. : Θουγενίδης is due to Pierson on
Moeris, p. 334). Owing to some similar
confusion Suid. s.v. ψεῦσον quotes the
verse of Aristophanes as if it had been
written by rather than adapted from
Sophocles.</p>
<p>μὴ ψεῦσον. It may be assumed that
Sophocles was imitating the three
Homeric examples: Δ 410 τῷ μή μοι

σὺ μὲν μή πω καταδύσεο μῶλον Ἄρηος,
ω 248 ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δὲ μὴ χόλον
ἔνθεο θυμῷ. Even these appear to be
isolated attempts to extend the development
of the present imperative in prohibitions
(Monro, H.G. 2 § 328), rather
than the survival of an earlier usage. —
dvcv δορός. The meaning might conceivably
be ‘ don't slay me unarmed,'
in Horn. Φ 50 γυμνόν, ἄτερ κόρυθός τε
καὶ aairibos, οὐδ’ ἔχεν ἔγχος: but, apart
from other objections, δόρυ was a weapon
of offence. We should interpret rather
‘ without (using) the sword, i.e. far from
the battle ; it is the prayer of the old
warrior to hear once more the clash of
arms. Of course Zeus is not thought of
as the actual agent, but as the ultimate
cause. On the other hand, δόρυ has not
yet reached the meaning ’ war ’ or
’ battle ’ so decisively as e.g. in Eur. Ion
997 θεῶν ὅτ' ἦλθεν ἐς δόρυ (Wilamowitz
on Eur. Jler. 158), although a spear is
not necessarily the weapon intended any
more than in Ai. 1056, or Eur. Tro. 387
οὓς δ’ ἔλοι δόρυ. The phrase ἄνευ δορός
and its equivalents do not always convey
the same nuance: see on fr. 941, 15, and
Eur. Hclid. 396. Generally perhaps,
in Aesch. Eum. 289 or Eur. Bacch. 804
the implication is only ‘ without using
’ Cf. Track. 1063 μόνη με δὴ καθεῖλε
φασγάνου δίΧα. Welcker thought that
there was a reference to the famous spear
of Peleus (Hom. II 143), and that Zeus
had promised him that it should never
fail his need ; Vater still more improbably
that Peleus was speaking of the assistance
of Neoptolemus, which he knew to
be near at hand.</p>

Lobeck, Phryn. p. 572) οὕτως ἐλέγετο.
Σοφοκλῆς Πηλεῖ ‘ καὶ . . . πτυχῶν.’</p>
<p>This is our best authority for the
meaning of the archaic word ξηραλοιφεῖν,
which hardly occurs except in allusion
to the law of Solon forbidding slaves to
frequent the gymnasia, as in Aeschin. l.c.
That it had passed out of use in the fourth
century is indicated by the fact that the
orator, referring to the omission from
the law of an express enactment of the
licence implied in its veto, proceeds :
καὶ οὐκέτι προσέγραψε· τὸν δ’ ἐλεύθερον
ἀλείφεσθαι καὶ γυμνάζεσθαι. The explanation
of Didymus is preserved also by
Eustath. Il. p. 764, and by Hesych. Ill
p. 170; and ξηρὸς ἱδρώς, ὁ μὴ ὑπὸ λούτρου
ἀλλ' ὑπὸ γυμνασίων καὶ Κόνων γινόμενος
(Plat. Phaedr. 239 C), is adduced in
support. The origin of the word would
then be due to the earlier use of oil as an
unguent exclusively in connexion with
the bath. An alternative view, but
inferior in authority, is preserved by
Etym. Μ. p. 612, 20 ( = Bekk. anecd.
p. 284, 1) τὸ ἐν Tah παλαίστραις γυμναζόμενον

p. 213, reconciles the two statements
on the ground that, whereas oil
was used together with water in bathing,
κόνις was not ; and therefore the mention
of κόνις) ( water is intended to distinguish
ξηραλοιφεῖν from χυτλῶσαι· μετ' ἐλαίου
Xoijaaadat (Hesych. IV p. 301). The distinction
is clearly marked in Galen xi
532: in taking a bath, the water remains
on the surface; so it has to be rubbed
into the pores with oil, ὅπερ ὠνόμαζον οἱ
παλαιοὶ χυτλολῦσθαι καὶ ἀντετίθεσάν γε

<pb n="147"/>
αὐτοῦ τὸ ξηραλοιφεῖν. But ἀλείφεσθαι
served equally well to describe either
process, unless it was necessary to express
the opposition between anointing after
bathing and at the gymnasium. Inasmuch
as the use of oil was always prescribed
for the latter, it is odd to find
Philostr. gymn. 58 condemning ξηραλοιφεῖν
together with πυριᾶσθαι as belonging
to τῆς ἀγροικοτέρας γυμναστικῆς. üthner
can only explain it by supposing that
Philostratus misunderstood the obsolete
term as if it referred to the anointing of
the dry sweat which was excited by the
πυρίασις. The same critic holds that
ξηροτριβεῖσθαι denotes a dry rub, and is
not to be confounded with ξηραλοιφεῖν.</p>
<p>Here we must apparently translate
’ anointing (himself) through the folds of
his tunic ’ ; and Sophocles is guilty of an
anachronism in referring to the heroic
age a practice which Thucydides (i. 6)
states to have been introduced by the
Spartans: iyvfiuibdrjcraM re πρῶτοι, καὶ ἐς
τὸ φανερὸν airodCvTes Xiwa μέτα τοῦ γυμνάζεσθαι
ἠλείψαντο. But, if we are justified
in drawing the inference apart from the
context, it would seem that in mentioning
an athlete as clothed Sophocles supports
the authority of Thucydides, afterwards
confirmed by Plato (rep. 452 C), that the
complete stripping of the body was unknown
to the Homeric Greeks.</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>495 Steph. Byz. p. 392, 5 Κυκνῖτις·
ἧς ὁ Κύκνος ἐβασίλευσε. Σοφοκλῆς ἐν
Πηλεῖ. Meineke wished to add χώρα
QeTTaXias before ἧς, but, whether he is
right or not, the reference is undoubtedly
to the Thessalian district infested by the
robber Cycnus, the son of Ares, who was
slain by Heracles. Thus the reference
fits in with the topography of the play.
Hesiod (Scut. 70) brings Cycnus to the
precinct of Apollo at Pagasae. The
same neighbourhood is definitely named
by Eur, Her. 389 ἄν τε Μηλιάδ' ἀκτὰν |
Ἀναύρου παρὰ πηγὰς | Κύκνον ξεινοδαΐκταν
| τόξοις ὥλεσεν, Ἀμφαναί- | as οἰΚήτορ’
ἄμεικτον. Later writers, while still
naming Thessaly, go farther afield : thus
Itonos in Achaea Phthiotis is mentioned
as the scene of the fight with Cycnus by
Apollod. 2. 155, Diod. 4. 37, and Nicolaus
of Damascus fr. 55 (FHG III 389) ;
but Pausan. i. 27. ὁ puts it in the neighbourhood
of Peneus. — Stephanus confused
Cycnus with his namesake : see on
fr. 499.</p>
<p>496</p>
<p>496 Antiatt. (Bekk. anecd.) p. 106,
13 λιποψυχεῖν · Σοφοκλῆς Πηλεῖ.</p>
<p>L. and S. erroneously quote the reference
in support of the meaning, to fail
in courap-e. There is no evidence that
Sophocles used the word in any other
than its ordinary sense, to faint. The
degraded form λειποψυχεῖν, impossible
in verse, still lingers in many prose texts:
see Cobet, N.L. p. 79.</p>
<p>ΠΟΙΜΕΝΕΣ</p>
<p>The Ποιμένες comprised the events which immediately succeeded
the first landing of the Greeks upon the Trojan coast,
and thus occupied the interval between the Σύνδειπνοι and the
‘Ελένης ἀπαίτησις 1. Such at least was the order of the narrative
<note type="footnote">1 See however 1 Ρ. 121 for another view.</note>

<pb n="148"/>
in the Cypria, if we may judge from the abstract of Proclus
(EGF p. 19): ἔπειτα ἀποβαίνοντας αὐτοὺς εἰς Ἴλιον εἴργουσιν οἱ
Τρῶες, καὶ θνήσκει Πρωτεσίλαος ὑφ' Ἕκτορος. ἔπειτα Ἀχιλλεὺς
αὐτοὺς τρέπεται ἀνελὼν Κύκνον τὸν Ποσειδῶνος, καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς
ἀναιροῦνται. According to ApoUodorus (epit. 3. 29 ff.), Thetis
had warned Achilles that the first man who landed must die.
The Trojans, hearing of the arrival of the Greeks, advanced
under arms to the coast, and prevented their landing by volleys
of stones. Protesilaus was the first to step on shore, and killed
several of the Trojans before he was himself slain by Hector.
Then Achilles landed with the Myrmidons, and killed Cycnus
by striking him on the head with a stone. The Trojans were
scared by his death, and retreated to the city.</p>
<p>That the death of Protesilaus and the episode of Cycnus
belonged to this play appears to be established by frs. 497, 499,
and 500, and the inclusion of fr. 501 is the natural consequence.
Fr. 498 shows that Hector was one of the characters. On the
question whether Andromache also appeared see I p. 78. It is
not known whether the story of Laodamia was related in the
Cypria ; but it is barely possible that it was included in the
Πομένες, which was constructed from the Trojan standpoints1.</p>
<p>Welcker 2 suggested that the action took place outside
a temple on the sea-coast, where Hector was surprised by the
sudden arrival of the enemy. Frs. 502 and 503 are with reason
assigned to the speech of a messenger who related the approach
of the Greek fleet, and fr. 504 probably occurred in the same
context. The chorus consisted of Phrygian shepherds, whose
pastoral labours were rudely interrupted by the fear of invasion.
Frs. 505, 515, 519, and 521 are thus entirely appropriate to their
character. For the same reason Welcker ascribed to this play
frs. 793 and 812.</p>
<p>It was probably not until after ’s departure for the
spot whence danger threatened, that Cycnus appeared upon
the scene. This famous warrior was the son of Poseidon,
and the king of Colonae, a town in the Troad opposite to Tenedos 3.
The dazzling whiteness of his complexion — obviously
suggested by his — was probably mentioned by the author
of the Cypria, as may be legitimately inferred from Theocr. 16.

προτέρων ὕμνησαν ἀοιδοί; At any rate, something of the kind was
known to Hesiod (fr. 119 Rz.) and Hellanicus (FHG 1 49), and
we need not hesitate to suppose that Sophocles also made it
part of his description 1. The victory of Achilles over Cycnus
was reckoned amongst his most celebrated achievements: see
Find. Ol. 2. 91, Isth. 5. 39. Similarly Aristotle (rhet. 2. 22.
1396 b 18), coupling the death of Hector with that of Cycnus,
explains why Achilles earned peculiar distinction through the
defeat of the latter : he was invulnerable ἄτρωτος), and stopped
the disembarkation of the army. The legend that Cycnus was
invulnerable was unquestionably old, and a fragment which has
come to light since the publication of Nauck's second edition
(fr. 500) proves that it was known to Sophocles. There were
similar stories concerning the invulnerability of Ajax and
Achilles 2, which have been shown to be early; and the immunity
of Ajax was recorded by Aeschylus 3. In all such cases ἄτρωτος
meant not so much indestructible as impervious to spear or
’’; and that is no doubt the reason why we meet the
tradition that Cycnus was crushed by a stone. That may have
been the version of the Cypria 5 and it was still retained by
Lycophron 5; but there were others who were not unnaturally
dissatisfied with such a crude device. For it is unHkely that
Ovid, who describes the combat at length (Met. 12. 72 ff.), drew
entirely upon his own invention, when he made Cycnus trip over
a stone, and Achilles throttle him by drawing tight the strap of
his helmet (ib. 140 ff). Did he take a hint here from Sophocles ?</p>
<p>That Cycnus behaved as a somewhat arrogant boaster seems
to be indicated by fr. 501, and perhaps by fr. 507.</p>
<p>Ar. Ran. 963 implies that Aeschylus put Cycnus on the
stage, but, as no confirmatory evidence is extant, it remains
doubtful whether the statement applies to the son of Ares or
the son of Poseidon.</p>
<p>Ηermann' inferred from the character of the fragments that
the Ποιμένες, if not a satyr-play, was scarcely a serious tragedy,
and that it belonged to the class of tragi-comedies to which the
Alcestis of Euripides has often been assigned. That the play

persons, it does not seem unlikely that

<pb n="151"/>
his second illustration was still more
irrelevant as not being directly concerned
with locality at all. It is true that, as
Cycnus is not a place-name, we can
hardly compare Eur. Phoen. 301 Φοίνσσαν
βοάν ; but the termination of the adjective
may have been intended to suggest a
local dialect. At least there is no obvious
reason why KvkvItis should have been
preferred to KvKveia : late examples, like
Galen's φαρμακῖτις βίβλος referred to by

see Introductory Note.</p>
<p>1 καὶ μή. The recovery of the true
reading is very difficult in the absence
of the context, but the following points
may be noted, (i) The style of the
passage and the word ὑβρίζων are entirely
in keeping with the character of
a boaster who considered himself invulnerable,
although ’s reference
to Tzetz. Antehom. 257 in this connexion
is an error. (2) Brunck's Καὶ μὴν. . .σ'
ἐλῶ is an attractive conjecture which J.
was inclined to approve ; but the key to
the solution lies in recognizing that ἐκ
βάθρων means funditus, ‘utterly,’ and
thus requires the retention of ἕλω. Cf.
Eur. El. 608 σὺ δ’, ἐΚ βάθρων γὰρ πᾶς
avfipriaai. φίλοις, which is sufficient to
justify the metaphorical use. Lycophr.
770 μέλαθρον ἄρδην ἐΚ βάθρων ἀνάστατον,
of ’ home in Ithaca, does not
imply literal destruction. Similarly Α. Ρ.
15. 22. 4 χρυσοβαφεῖς δ’ ἐστυφέλιξ' ἐΚ
θεμέθλων ἄνακτας (misunderstood by Edmonds,
Gr. Bucol. Poets, Ρ. 489). The
literal meaning is common : A.P. 9. 97
εἰσέτι Τροίην δερκόμεθ' ἐΚ βάθρων πᾶσαν
ἐρειπομένην, Pollux 1. 12 ἐΚ βάθρων ἀνασπάσαι
νεών). Dio Chrys. 37 42. We
cannot therefore render ‘ I will drive
(you)...from your station' (J.), as if
βάθρων referred to ’the position of the
Greeks on the rocks near the coast (fr.
502 παραλίαν πέτραν: cp. Ph. 1000 γῆς
τόδ' αἰπεινὸν βάθρον).’ (3) We conclude
that the corruption is limited to the
opening syllables, and that kuI μὴ σ’ or
σφ' or even μὴ καί σ’ σφ') should be read,
unless the quotation was intended to run
καὶ μὴ. . .ὑβρίζων. (4) The emendation

<pb n="152"/>
of Μ. Schmidt (see cr. n. ) rests on a
comparison of Apostol. 12. 63 (Paroem.
II 557) ὅλῳ ποδί· ἐπὶ τῶν ταχέως τι ποιούντων,
ὁμοία τῇ ‘ ὅλῳ ῥυτῆρι.’ But the
phrase has no place in this context.</p>
<p>2 ῥυτῆρι. The simplest and best
explanation of the passage is that ῥυτήρ
means a lash, as in Ai. 241 and elsewhere,
with ὑπτίου ποδός as genitive of
definition, i.e. (consisting of) the flat of
the foot. The burlesque tone was no
doubt in character. Pollux 9. 126 explains
ῥοθαπυγίζειν (Ar. Εp. 796) as the
game σιμῷ τῷ ποδὶ τὸν γλουτὸν παίειν,
— an explanation which goes back to
Aristophanes (fr. 82 Nauck). To some
such form of horse-play Sophocles appears
to allude : was it anything like
’ running the gauntlet ’ ? Other explanations
are as follows: (i) The schol. on
O.C. 900 quotes Praxiphanes, the Peripatetic
and pupil of Theoplirastus, as
having explained ῥυτῆρος in σπεύδειν ἀπὸ
ῥυτῆτος by βλαύτης, ἀΚούων τὸ ὑπόδημα
οἷον τῶν ποδῶν τὸ κάλυμμα. No doubt,
as J. remarks, he derived the word from
ῥύεσθαι= ‘protector’ of the foot. Hence
Meineke (O.C. p. 211), with the approval
of Nauck, takes the word here as =calceus,
the shoe or sandal: cf. fr. 527
παράρρυμα ποδός (n.). (2) Campbell
understands, ‘ the hardened sole of the
foot, — compared to a piece of hide.
(3) Hesych. records an alternative view,
to the effect that Cycnus threatens to
make his foe run so fast as to strike his
own buttocks with upturned feet. In
that case for the use of Κρούων see on
fr. 620.</p>

source of both quotations was
Apollodorus of Athens, the famous
grammarian of the second century B.C.,
in his book περὶ τῶν Ἀθήνησιν ἑταιρίδων
(Athen. 586 Α). Different views are held
regarding the intermediate stages through
which the extract reached Harpocration
and Athenaeus (Schwartz in Pauly-Wissowa
I 2863; Schultz, ’did. vii 2415).</p>
<p>‘ The extract is taken from the speech
of a messenger, a goat-herd, who announces
(to Hector) the approach of the
Greeks (Welcker, p. 114) ’ (J.).</p>

It is against the former that
we only need a mark of time, and there
was no reason why the goat-herd should
wish to escape notice. This consideration
induced Meineke to substitute περᾶν for
ὁρᾶν. — αὐλιτῶν. Hesych. Ι Ρ. 322 has
αὐλήτην· τὸν τοῦ κόπρου ἐπιμελούμενον
τῶν προβάτων. This was corrected by
Meineke (on Steph. Byz. p. 146, 10) to
ἀυλίτην on the strength of the reading
ί
αὐλητην in the codex Rhedigeranus. It
is generally considered that the lemma of
Hesychius refers to the present passage,
and Μ. Schmidt consequently wished to
read αὐλιτῶν· τῶν. . .ἐπιμελουμένων. In
Ap. Rhod. 4. 1487 ἀυλίτης was restored
by Merkel for αὐλείτης αὐλήτης four Paris
MSS). αὐλίτης comes ‘ from αὐλή as
= farm-yard (Hom. Δ 433, where sheep
stand in it : Ω 640 αὐλῆς ἐν χόρτοισι κυλινδόμενος
κατὰ κόπρον)’ (J.). For the form
see on fr. 92.</p>

θαλλὸς πᾶν τὸ θάλλον. κυρίως δὲ ὁ τῆς

by the evidence of literature,
where it nearly always means an olivebranch.
See Ruhnken in ἰοί. for the
phrase θαλλὸν ποροσείειν to dangle a bait,
like a branch before hungry cattle (H.).

The loss of σ was due to the fact that
before tt or r it was written as a small loop
attached to them: so Auratus restored

φῆμαι πονηραί of M (H.).</p>
<p>3 στείχοντα παραλίαν πέτραν. The
words may mean, as J. remarks, either
(1) ’advancing to the rocks by the ’ or
(2) ’ moving along ’ (or ‘over’) them
(Aesch. Prom. 734 στεῖχ' ἀνηρότους γύας,
and see n. on Eur. Hel. 598). The latter
is preferable, so far as we can judge in
the absence of context; but it is difficult
to decide between Harpocration's πέτραν
and Athenaeus' ἄκραν. Cf. fr. 905 παρακτίαν
στείχων. . .ὁδόν(of Theseus). Tucker
(C.R. XVIII 245) suggested that irXdKa is

<p>1 ἔνθ' ‘ probably refers to the coasts
of the Troad ’ (J.). — πηλαμύς was the
name given to the tunny which had
not yet arrived at its full size, or, more
accurately, during the period lasting from
the time it was six months old until the
end of its first year: Arist. h. an. 6. 17.
571 a 15 ἡ δ’ αὔξησίς ἐστι τῶν θυννίδων
ταχεῖα· ὅταν γὰρ τέκωσιν οἱ ἰχθύες ἐν τῷ

οὖσαι πηλαμύδες. ib. 571 a 11 δοκοῦσι δ’
ἐνιαυτῷ εἶναι πρεσβύτεροι τῷν πηλαμύδων.
In the same treatise (8. 13. 598 a 26) Aristotle
again states that θυννίδες and πηλαμύδες
pass into the Euxine from western
waters in the spring and spend the
summer there. These passages will explain
how the πηλαμύς winters in the
Hellespont. Nauck thinks that Hesychius
(III p. 33 1) and Photius Ρ. 428, 12),
who explain that πηλαμύς should be
written 810, διὰ v (not πηλαμίσ), are referring
to this passage.</p>
<p>2 πάραυλος ‘Ελλησποντίς, ‘lodged
near us in the Hellespont. Cp. O.C.
785 ὡς πάραυλον οἰκίσῃς, “plant me near
the borders," Ai. 892
restored πάραυλος from Hesych. ΙΙΙ p. 278
πάραυλος. ‘πάραυλος ‘Ελλησπόντου ὥρα
θέρους.’ ἡ κατὰ τὸ θέρος ἀκμάζουσα. Cf.
ὅμαυλος fr. 24. Even so the reinforcement
of πάροικος ‘ neighbouring ’ : Ant 1 155)
by πάραυλος is hardly satisfactory. —
ὡραία : the πηλαμύδες were distinguished
from τὸ oopaia, as the tunnies were
called at a year old (Athen. 116 Ε).
The ὡραῖον of Byzantium was esteemed
the choicest of delicacies: Archestratus
(in the ἡδυπάθεια, c. 330 B.C.) ap.
117 A ἂν δ’ ἀφίκῃ κλεινοῦ Βυζαντίου εἰς
πόλιν ἁγνήν, | ὡραίου φάγε μοι τέμαχος
πάλιν· ἐστὶ γὰρ ἐσθλὸν | καὶ μαλακόν.
ὡραία means therefore ‘ reaching its
’ and this may also be the meaning
of the disputed horaeum scombrtim in
Plaut. Capt. 851.</p>
<p>3 τῇδε: see cr. n. ‘ If τῷδε be kept,
render: “since it is frequent for ”
i.e. “ for it is his constant ” The
middle voice, which is found only here,
= the act. θαμίζω (O.C. 672)' (J.).
the Sophoclean middle see on fr. 858.
The gloss of Hesychius (II Ρ. 299 θαμίζεται·
ὁμιλεῖ) is taken, probably with
justice, to refer to this passage ; but, inasmuch
as θαμίζειν nowhere else has the
sense of ὁμιλεῖν c. dat., I incline to think
that Ellendt was right. The corruption
was natural with τῷ Βοσπ0ρίτῃ preceding.</p>

Nauck proposed (but subsequently abandoned)
οἶδ᾿ ἄκους τυχεῖν (or τυχόν), and
Headlam λόγου γὰρ ἕλκος οὐδὲν ἰατροῦ
τυχεν. It may be that Dindorf's πω is
all that is required (see Jebb on Phil.
256), and that the beginning of the next
line, which completed the sense, has been
lost (e.g. &#x003C;ἰασίμου σωτῆρος&#x003E;: for the
infinitive see Goodw.§ 915, 2 b). But
with such an original it is not easy to
account for χανόν, which must be an
explanatory adscript. I suggest οἶδα
συμπτυγέν (or, as is perhaps preferable,
συμπτυχέν): although I cannot prove
that συμπτύσσω was used for the closing
of a wound like συναρμόζω or συναρτῶ,
there seems to be no reason why Sophocles
should not have employed it in that
sense. This conjecture has been partially
anticipated, as I have since learnt, by
Tucker (C.R. xviii 246), who reads που
(or πω) πτυχέν, and supports it by the
medical use of πτύγμα and πτυκτόν as
‘a bandage.’ For λόγῳ Gomperz aptly
compares Aesch. Theb. 702 τεθηγμένον
τοι μ᾿ οὐκ ἀπαμβλυνεῖς λόγῳ, where the
different distribution of the emphasis
should be observed.</p>

<p>509 Erotian gloss. Hippocr. p. 109,
7 πελλόν· ὑποφαιόν. ἀγνοοῦντες δέ τινες

Ποιμέσι καὶ ἐν Ἀμφιαράῳ (fr. 114) φησί
‘κυνὸς πέλλης τε μηκάδος βοὸς ῥηνέων.’
The glossary of Erotian has been entirely
transformed and considerably mutilated
in the course of transmission; and the
present passage has suffered irreparable
damage. Thus Klein rightly points out
that some words must have been lost
before ὡς, since the intention cannot be
to accuse Soph, of ignorance in adopting
the form πέλιος. If this evidence stood
alone, we should probably infer that the
quotation from the Ποιμένες had also
been lost, but we know from another
source (see on fr. 114) that the words
κυνὸς . . . ῥηνέων do not come from the
Amphiaraus. It is generally assumed
that they represent an iambic trimeter
quoted from the Ποιμένες: thus Duentzer
would emend the first part by writing
αἰγός τε πελλῆς μηκάδος, and for the last
two words Brunck read ῥινὸν βοός, Lobeck
βοῦ τ᾿ ἄρσενος, and Schneidewin
βοὸς | ῥινόν. Klein tentatively suggested
ῥινῶν (vulg. ῥινέων). I am not satisfied
that these corrupt words ever formed
a piece of continuous verse, and cannot
in any case accept the ‘bleating cow’
which L. and S. and others ascribe to
Sophocles. μηκάδος, with or without
αἰγός, must mean a goat. It is impossible
to avoid the conclusion that ῥηνέων is
corrupt; Sophocles surely did not use the
Alexandrian ῥήν, a rare poetic word,
generally supposed to be a mistaken formation
due to πολύρρην and ignorance of
ἀρήν (see on fr. 655). Still less can it
belong to Hippocrates or his interpreters.
It may of course be a corruption of ῥινόν,
especially if Schneidewin's restoration of
fr. 114 is correct: for in that case we
should have to recognize in Erotian
a conflation of two separate quotations.
But I have sometimes thought that
ῥηνέων might have come from ἑρμηνεύων,
a scholiastic word (schol. El. 505), and
that the original intention was to quote
from both plays merely enough to prove
that Sophocles applied the word πελλός
to the colour of a dog, a goat, and an
ox.—πελλός, which comes, I suppose,
from *πελ-νό-ς, is akin to πελιός, πελιδνός,
πολιός, Πέλοψ, Lat. pullus etc.
The accent wavers: thus the Macedonian
Pella is said to be so called
ὅτι βοῦς αὐτὴν εὗρε πέλλη Etym. Μ. Ρ.
659, 38; but cf. Theocr. 5. 99 τὰν οἶν
τὰν πέλλαν (πελλάν vulg.). In Arist.
h. an. 9. 1. 609b 22 τῶν ἐρωδιῶν ὅ τε
πέλλος καὶ ὁ λευκός it may be a noun, as
Lobeck points out (Paralip. p. 343). As
to the meaning J. remarks: ‘Common
root-sense, “pale”; then ash-coloured,
livid, black-and-blue, and so
darkcoloured.’</p>

undoubtedly referred to by Hesych. iv

Ὀλυμπιάδων ἐζευγμένον.</p>
<p>The lines from the Andrornache on
which the scholiast is commenting are as
follows: ὅτ' Ἰδάιαν | ἐς νάπαν ἦλθ' ὁ
Μαί-| as τε καὶ Διὸς τόΚος, | τρίπωλον
ἄρμα δαιμόνωνΙ ἄγων τὸ καλλιζυγλές, Ι

σταθμοὺς ἐπὶ βούτα, | βοτῆρα τ' ἀμφὶ
μονότροπον νεανίαν | ἕρημόν θ' | ἑστιοῦχον
αὐλάν. The scene represented is the
arrival of the three goddesses on Mt
Ida to submit themselves to the judgement
of Paris. The contrast between the
majesty of the goddesses and the rustic
seclusion of Paris was especially attractive
to Euripides who often recurs to the
theme : see Hel. 357, Hec. 644, I.A. 180
1291 ff. In all these passages, in order
to mark the contrast referred to, Paris
is called the herdsman : see Tr. fr. adesp.
286 ὡς Πριαμίδαισιν ἐμφερὴς ὁ βουκόλολς,
Headlam on Aesch. Ag. 718. There is
enough to show that the same feeling
underlies the present passage, but the
conditions are too uncertain to admit of
emendation. Even the character of the
metre cannot be determined ; for, although
it appears to be anapaestic, the
fii-st two lines may consist of an enhoplic
followed by a gly conic as in Ant. 11 1140 f.
In the latter case we might read ἀγεννῆ
τ' ἐπὶ βούσταθμον or the like ; but, although
ἀγεννῶς is admitted in dialogue
by Eur. Ι. Α. 1457, we should hardly
expect to find this peculiarly Attic word
in a Sophoclean lyric. The words τὴν
τῆς Ἴδης can hardly be anything but
a gloss or the remains of one, and the
text to which they were attached probably
contained ’Ibaiav : see schol. Ai.
604 Ἰδαίᾳ δὲ οἶ·ον ἐν τῷ τῆς Ἴδης χωρίῳ
κτἑ. If so, Ἴδης in the first line must
also be an intruder, and, if ἀγενναι conceals
a case of ἀγέλη, we should have to
write something like x003E; δ’ ἤδη
ποτὲ μηλοτρόφους Ι ἀγέλαν τ’ Μιν τὴν
Ἰδαίαν τριολύμπιον ἅρμα. Or ἀγενναι
may be the remains of d x003E; γενναῖ x003E; :
cf. Eur. Ι.Α. 573 ἔμολες, ὦ Πάρις, ᾗτε
σύ γε Ι βουκόλος ἀργενναῖς ἐτράφης |
Ἰδαίαις παρὰ μόσχοις. Of previous conjectures
we may record those of (i) Hermann:
Ἴδης 17 δή ποτε μηλοτρόφου ναέτῃ
κρίνειν ἤντησεν ἄγων Ἑρμῆς τριολύμπιον
ἅρμα. (2) Wecklein : Ἰδης Ι ὅτε μηλοτρόφων
ἀγελῶν ποιμένες Ι εἶδον τ. ἅ. (3)
Mekler: οἶδ' ὡς δήποτελ μηλοτρόφῳ σᾷ |
γέννᾳ...ἤντησ' Ἴδης | τριολύμπιον ἅρμα
x003E; . He supposes that the

words were addressed to Priam or Hecuba.
(4) For ayevvaL τὴ Herwerden
conjectured ἄγεν Ἄτη, but despaired of</p>
<p>3 τριολύμπιον ἅρμα is correctly explained
by the Hesychian gloss (supr.).
To us the metaphor seems forced, for
the phrase means nothing more than
’three goddesses coming ’; but
it is exactly paralleled by Eur. ’s τρίπωλον
ἅρμα δαιμόνων and is common elsewhere,
especially with ζεῦγος: Eur. fr. 357
ζεῦγος τριπάρθενον (the three daughters
οἱ Erchtheus),Tro 924 ἔκρινε τρισσὸν

<p>Blaydes conjectures Φοινικίοισι. — The
earliest authority for the Phoenician
origin of the Greek alphabet is Hdt. 5.
58, who, after describing its introduction
by Cadmus, proceeds to account for the
name Phoenician becoming current :
Ἴωνες. . .παραλαβόντες διδαχῇ παρὰ τῶν
Φοινίκων τὸ γράμματα. . .ἐφάτισαν, ὥσπερ
καὶ τὸ δίκαιον ἔφερε ἐσαγαγόντων Φοινίκων
ἐς τὴν Ἑλλάδα, Φοινικήια KeKXija-dai. Even
on a Teian inscription Φοινικήια is the
name given to the letters inscribed on
the stone (IGA 497). Later authorities
such as Ephorus (FHG I 270), Aristotle

<pb n="159"/>
(fr. 501 R.), Pliny (n. h. 7. 192), and
Tacitus (ann. 11. 14), give similar
accounts; for it makes little difference
whether Cadmus is described as the
actual inventor, or merely the importer
of the letters into Greece. The tradition
accords with the results of modern investigation
(see Macan on Hdt. l.c.) ;
but there were other stories current,
ascribing the invention to Hermes, Prometheus,
Linus, Palamedes, or Cecrops.
It is interesting to find Sophocles again
in accord with Herodotus, though the
name Φοινίκια appears to have prevailed
apart from the story of Cadmus. Hdt.

<p>This word, which is said to be Semitic
and akin to Baal and Bel, is introduced
in order to give an oriental colouring to
the dialect of the chorus. So in frs. 517
520, and in the Troilus (frs. 631, 634)
and Ἑλένης γάμος (fr. 183). It was one
of the few terms which would be easily
recognized: cf. Aesch. Pers. 660 (in the
invocation to Darius) βαλλὴν ἀρχαῖος
βαλλὴν ἴθι ἱκοῦ, where schol. Μ has
βαλλῆνα τὸν βασιλέα. Εὐφορίων δὲ Θουρίων
φησὶ τὴν διάλεκτον. — βαλλήν· βασιλεύς
κατὰ Θουρίους. The curious statement
thus attributed to Euphorion is discredited
by Meineke, Anal. Alex. Ρ. 142, who
corrects Θουρίων to Φρυγίων. Herodian
περὶ μον. λεξ. p. 17, 5 and Arcad. p. 9, i
also support the spelling βαλλήν, so that
the weight of authority is strongly against
βαλήν, which Lobeck (Paral. p. 19 r n.)
and Μ. Schmidt on insufficient grounds
preferred. The later scholia on Aesch.
l.c. have the additional statement Wev
καὶ Βαληναῖον ὄρος, ὅ ἐστι βασιλικόν, which
also appears in Eustath. Il. p. 381, 17
Od. p. 1854, 26. They appear to have
derived it from the account of the river
Sagaris given by the impudent forger,
who attempted to foist upon Plutarch
the treatise de fluviis, and whose frauds
have been exposed by Hercher (pseudo-
Plut. de fluv. 12. 3, 4): in the same
passage is a remark about the Βαλλὴν
λίθος, which is equally unworthy of credence,
and another about Ballenaeus,
the son of Ganymede, who founded a

epigram (A.P. 7. 365 it is used of
Charon's boat. We should therefore
expect it to denote a Trojan vessel
as in Eur. l.A. 297, unless indeed the

<p>It has been assumed from as early as
the third century B.C. down to our own
times that the whole race which was
afterwards known as Hellenes had previously
been called called It ought to
be enough to refute this fallacy that we
can trace the progress of the name Hellenes,
which ex hypothesi is later, from
its origin as a tribal appellation until it
finally becomes national. For there was
no Greek nation in prehistoric times.
Yet even Mommsen (Hist. i 140 E. tr.)
argues that ’the Italians had become
acquainted with the Greek nation before
the newer name Hellenes had supplanted
the older national designation ’
The earliest authority which can be invoked
in support of the theory is Arist.
meteor. 1. 14. 352 b 2, who however only
says that the Selli and the people formerly
known as Γραικοί but afterwards as
Hellenes dwelt in the neighbourhood of
Dodona. But the case is different from
the third century onwards, when the infjuence
of Greece upon the outside world
became of more importance than her
national history. So the Parian Marble
(FHG 1 542) : Ἕλληνες ὠνομάσθησαν τὸ
πρότερον Γραικοὶ καλούμενοι. Apollod. i.
50 : Hellen ἀφ' αὐτοῦ τοὺς καλουμένους
Γραικοὺς προσηγόρευσεν Ἕλληνας. By the
Alexandrian pedants Γαραικός began to be
used in place of Ἕλλην : see Callimachus
ap. Strab. 46 (fr. 104) and Etym. Μ.
p. 239, 15 (fr. 160), Lycophr. 532, 891
1 195 etc. But in classical literature
Γραικός etc. are essentially local names;
Γραῖα (B 498) was somewhere in the
valley of the Asopus, and Γαρϊκή (Thuc.
2. 23) was the coastland of Boeotia
opposite to Eretria. It is significant that
the Euboean colonization of Cumae was
according to tradition the earliest occasion
on which Greek influences were brought
into contact with the Italians. Such is
the evidence for the use of Γραικός, and
’s scepticism (up. p. 270) in relation
to the statement of Stephanus is justified.
Of course the grammarians were on the
look out for any scrap of evidence which
would bolster up their theory of the old
Γραικοί, but it is much more likely that
γραῖκες both in Alcman and in Sophocles
was nothing but a synonym of γρᾶες. For
these reasons I have dropped the capital
letter. That is the view of Dittenberger in
Herm. XLI 100, who points out that the
Greeks had no ethnica in κος, and thinks
that Graecus was built up from Grains on
Italian soil, and passed thence to the
later Greek authorities. See also Niese
in Herm. XII 408, and Wilamowitz ib.
XXI 113. The question why the Romans
gave to Ἕλληνες the name Graeci has
been the subject of a good deal of discussion
in recent years. It is well summarized
by J. Miller in Pauly-Wissowa
VII 1693 f., who throws out the suggestion
that Grai may have been a purely Italian
designation of a strange people. G. Busolt,
solt, Griech. Geschichte 2, I 198 f., holds
that the Boeotian Γραϊκή was the dwellingplace
of a branch of the same people
which had occupied the neighbourhood
of Dodona before the great migrations,
and that the Italians learnt the name
from these western tribes. See further

διαςγγέλλοντας οὕτω λέγουσι, brilliantly
corrected by Papageorgius to παρασάγγῃ·

<p>It is not likely that Soph, and Eur.
made the blunder of confusing παρασάγγης
with ἄγγαρος or ἀστάνδης. But it may
well be that, in describing or referring to
the oriental couriers and the stages they
successively traversed (Hdt. 8. 98), they
spoke of the latter in such a way as to
cause a misunderstanding in the minds of
too literal readers. Cf. fr. 125, and for
parasangs at Troy see onfr. 183. Wecklein
thinks that the use of the word was
intentionally comic, and claims it as
supporting ’s view of the play,

<p>ΠΟΛΓΞΕΝΗ</p>
<p>The sacrifice of Polyxena in response to the demand of the

and it is certain that the Polyxena of Sophocles covered the
same ground as the first part of that play. So schol. Eur. Hec.

I τὰ περὶ Πολυξένην ἕστιν εὑρεῖν παρὰ Σοφοκλεῖ ἐν Πολυξένῃ 1.
The incident was recorded in the Ilhipersis, according to the
epitome of Proclus (EGF p. 50) : ἔπειτα ἀμπρήσαντες τὴν πόλιν
Πολυξένην σφαγιάζουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν τοὐ Ἀχιλλέως τάφον. It may
be that it was also contained in the Nosti ; for Proclus, in
abstracting that poem, after mentioning the quarrel of Agamemnon
and Menelaus (see on fr. 522), and the departure of
certain chieftains with Menelaus, states that, when Agamemnon
was about to sail (EGF p. 53), Ἀχιλλέως εἴδωλον ἐπιφανεν πειρᾶται
διακωλύειν προλέγον τὰ συμβησόμενα. In Euripides the
ghost so appearing required the sacrifice of Polyxena (Hec. 37
95); but Proclus merely states that his object was to warn the
Greeks of the disasters that would attend their voyage, and to
dissuade them from starting. If, then, we are to assume that
the narrative of the Nosti did not overlap that of the Iliupersis,
it was a later poet who connected the appearance of the ghost
with ’s death. According to schol. Eur. Hec. 41, Ibycus
(fr. 36) related that Polyxena was slain by Neoptolemus ; and
Longinus (de subl. 15. 7) couples Simonides (fr. 209) 2 with
Sophocles for the excellence of their description of the ghostly
vision: κατὰ τὸν ἀπόπλουν τῶν Ἑλλήνων (sc. ἄκρως ὁ Σοφοκλῆς
πεφάντασται) ἐπὶ τἀχιλλέως προφαινομένου τοῖς ἀναγομένοις ὑπὲρ
τοῦ τάφου, ἢν οὐΚ εἴ εἴ τις ὄψιν ἐναργέστερον εἰδωλοποίησε
Σιμωνίδου. In Quint. 14. 178 Achilles appeared to Neoptolemus
in a dream, and asked for Polyxena as his share of the booty.
F. Noack (Iliupersis, p. 11 ff.) conjectured that Sophocles was
the first to bring the appearance of the ghost into causal relation
with the sacrifice, and that Euripides attacked his version 3. But
the gaps in the evidence are too wide to permit us to entertain
such speculations.</p>
<p>Welcker justly considers that the play opened with the
strife between the Atridae, and that, when Menelaus departed,
Agamemnon resolved to remain behind in order to propitiate
Athena by sacrifice (fr. 522). He attributes fr. 887 to the
parodos of the chorus, who, if the conjecture is correct, must
have consisted rather of Greek soldiers than of Trojan captive
women. The scene of the play was on the Trojan coast, probably
in the neighbourhood of Sigeum, where Achilles was said
to have been buried 4. Welcker acutely remarks that the grave

<pb n="163"/>
cannot have been represented on the stage, since the undeviating
usage of tragedy required that the sacrifice of Polyxena should
be reported by a messenger and not enacted before the eyes of
the spectators. Hence he inferred that the ghost must have
come from the grave to the tent of Agamemnon. On the other
hand we have no right to disregard the evidence of Longinus,
who distinctly speaks of the phantom as appearing above the
tomb. In the present state of our knowledge, there does not
seem to be any way of escape from this dilemma : for the identity
of tomb and altar see on Eur. Hel. 547, Holzinger on Lycophr.
313, and the evidence since collected by Ridgeway, Origin of
Tragedy, p. 137 ff. However this may be, the ghost certainly
appeared upon the stage (fr. 523); and that it was Agamemnon
to whom his message was delivered is made additionally
probable by fr. 526, which seems to foretell the murder by
Clytaemnestra. Clearly Agamemnon is also the speaker of
fr. 524; but whether that is part of an answer to the phantom
intended to excuse the neglect of which he had complained, or
comes from a judgement delivered after hearing the conflicting
claims of Hecuba and Neoptolemus — both of whom were
probably characters in the — can hardly be determined.</p>
<p>Axist. poet. 23. 1459 b 7 gives a list of ’more than eight' —
there are actually ten — tragedies which are taken from the Little
Iliad, and among them is an otherwise unrecorded ἀπόπλους.
Welcker (p. 179) suggested that this was an alternative title of
the Polyxena of Sophocles ; and Ribbeck 1 agreed on the strength
of Longinus' words which have been quoted above. The
reference of this and other titles to the Little Iliad rather than
to the Iliiipersis has given much difficulty ; and it is generally
supposed that the concluding part of the Little Iliad was also
known as Iliupersis 2.</p>
<p>There is nothing to indicate that Sophocles made any use of
the love-motive which some of the authorities have introduced
into the story of Achilles and Polyxena 3. It is, therefore, unnecessary
to discuss the question whether it is ancient, or, as
others prefer to suppose, the invention of late romancers 4.</p>

<p>1 This line has been attacked on two
grounds: (i) because the Homeric αὖθι
does not occur elsewhere in tragedy.
But it is not easy to emend, for Nauck's
αὖτε, though Aeschylean, is only used by
Soph, at Track. 1009, and nowhere by
Eur. ; and this is just the place where we
might expect an echo of the Homeric
αὖθι μένειν (A 492, Ψ 674, ε 208 and
many other examples quoted by Ebeling
s.v.): cf. γ 155 — of this very incident —
ἡμίσεες δ’ ἄρα λαοὶ ἐρητύοντο μένοντες |
αὖθι παρ' Ἀτρεΐδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ποιμένι

Hence τῇδ' ἐπ’ (ἐν Blaydes) Ἰδαίᾳ χθονί
Ellendt, τήνδ' ἀν' Ἰδαίαν χθόνα Hartung

τοῦ also at At. 546, Track. 908. Wecklein
supported τοῦ, agreeing with Ὀλύμπου.</p>
<p>2 The Mysian Olympus is in fact
a considerable distance from Ida, although
Strabo calls it ὅμορος (l.c.). He adds, as
if to account for the confusion by which
Soph, speaks of Ida and Olympus as
forming the same range, that lour peaks
of Ida towards Antandros are called

is quoted by Porphyrius verbatim
from the twentieth book of the treatise
of Apollodorus περὶ τῶν θεῶν. Apollodorus
of Athens, the author of the χρονικά,
and the colleague and contemporary of
Aristarchus, whose life extended probably
from about 180 B.C. — 110 B.C., and was
spent at Athens, Alexandria, and Pergamus,
was one of the most celebrated
critics of antiquity. The treatise περὶ
θεῶν, which may be regarded as a history
of Greek religion, was a work — to quote
E. Schwartz in Pauly-Wissowa i 2875 —
‘ das ihm, seinem Denken und seinem
Herzen als eigenstes Eigentum gehort
und dessen Verlust am schwersten zu
verschmerzen ’</p>
<p>1 ἀπαίωνας (‘joyless ’) is interpreted</p>

<pb n="165"/>
<p>by Apoyodorus : τὰς παιῶν' οὐκ ἐχούσας.
The explanation of Valckenaer (on Eur.
Phoen. 1019), adopted by L. and S., that
the word is derived from αἰών, is clearly
wrong. The paean here and elsewhere
is typical of joy, and is contrasted with
the gloomy abode of the dead : so it is
said of Apollo (Aesch. Ag. 1059), οὐ γὰρ
τοιοῦτος ὥστε θρηνητοῦ τυχεῖν. Cf. Eur.
Ι.Τ. 182 τὰν ἐν θρήνοις μοῦσαν | νέκυσι
μελομέναν, τὰν ἐν μολπαῖς | Ἅιδας ὑμνεῖ
δίχα παιάνων. Hence, by oxymoron,
funeral lamentations are described as
’ paeans that are the portion of the dead ’ :
see Eur. Hel. 177 παιᾶνας νέκυσι μελομένους
(n.), Suppl. 976 ἀοιδαί θ' ἃς χρυσοκόμας
Ἀπολλὼν οὐκ ἐνδέχεται. In Aesch.
Ag. 650 παιᾶνα Ἐρινύων is applied to
a message heralding disaster. Hesych.
I p. 224 s.v. ἀπαιώνιστος quotes Eur.
(fr. 77) for the sense δύσφημος. — μελαμβαθεῖς,
‘ dark and deep ’ (i.e. in the
depths of the nether world) : cf. Aesch.
Prom. Ταρτάρου μελαμβαθὴς κευθμών.
Valckenaer's conjecture μελαμφαεῖς, for
which see on Eur. Hel. 518, is quite unnecessary
: the fact that P (see cr. n.)
has μελαμβαφεῖς is of no significance.</p>
<p>2 λιποῦσα : the fem. is unusual as
compared with Eur. Hec. 1, Aesch. Pers.
686, Hom. λ 90, Bacchyl. 5. 78 (H.).
There is no apparent reason for the
abnormal gender, which however the
context may have explained. — λίμνης.
Acheron is imagined sometimes as a
river, sometimes as a lake (El. 158 ἐξ
Ἀΐδα παγκοίνου λίμνας), and sometimes
as both: thus Plato (Phaed. 113 a) describes
the river Acheron as flowing into
the λίμνη Ἀχερουσιά. — After this word
there seems to have been a disturbance
of the tradition : see cr. n. Heyne is
followed by Wachsmuth and Nauck.
Grotius, who preferred to substitute
ἦλθον ἠχούσας γόοις Ι Ἀχέροντος ὀξυπλῆγος
ἄρσενας Χοός, is followed by
Brunck: similarly Dindorf, except that
he prints ἠχούσης γόυς, with Heeren.
Musgrave (on Hel. l.c.) proposed λίμνην
ἦλθον, ἄρσενας χοὸς | Ἀχέροντος, ὀξυπλῆγας
ἠχοῦσαν γόους. — ἄρσενας χοάς, a
very difficult phrase. Apollodorus explained
ἄρσενας as equivalent to τὰς
οὐδὲν ἐκτρεφούσας. θήλεα μὲν γὰρ rd
καρποφόρα, ἄρσενα δὲ τὰ ἀγονα ἔλεγον τῷ
τὸν μὲν τὸ σπέρμα παρέχειν μόνον, τὴν δὲ
καὶ ἐκτρέφειν· ὅθεν Καὶ ‘ θῆλυς ἐέρση’ ’
(Hom. ε 467) ἡ πολύγονος καὶ τροφίημ.
So far as I can discover, there appears to
be no other evidence for this meaning
of ἄρσην; but the statement of Apollodorus
cannot be lightly regarded, and
the sense itself is unexceptionable : for
rivers were regarded by the Greeks as
the givers of life and nourishment, so that
dpaiqp would be the negation of κουροτρόφος,
as applied to them (see Tucker
on Aesch. Cho. ὁ.. cf. Aesch. fr. 168
Ἱνάχου. . .παισὶν βιοδώροις). J. on the
other hand renders ‘ ’ comparing
Phil. 1455 Καὶ κτύπος ἄρση
πόντου προβολῆς, ‘ deep sound of the sealashed
’ Ar. Thesm. 124 κίθαριν)
ἄρσενι βοᾷ δόκιμον, Pers. 6. 4 atqtie marem
strepitum fidis intendisse Latinae. But
in all these passages ἄρσην — or its Latin
equivalent — is the epithet of a noun expressing
sound, a fact which entirely
distinguishes them from the present.
Blaydes would read βοός here. — χοάς,
fur which Meineke on O.C. p. 203 proposed
ῥοάς, is nowhere else applied to the
waters of a river; and it may be conjectured
that, but for its chthonian associations,
Sophocles would not have
ventured to connect the word with
Acheron in what must be taken to
be its literal sense ‘outpourings’): cf.
πορχοαι.</p>
<p>3 ὀξυπλῆγας ἠχούσας γόους: (r) J.
translated ‘ re-echoing the shrill strains
of ’ interpreting ὀξυπλῆηγας
‘ striking a shrill note, striking shrilly on
the ’ He compared ὀξυτονων γόων
in El. 244. (2) I prefer to understand
‘ wailing that accompanies fierce ’
i.e. the cries of the mourners as they
beat their breasts and heads. Cf. Aesch.
Cho. 23 ὀξύχειρι σὺν κτύπῳ, and see on
Eur. Hel. 372. The words are thus
a concise summary of Ai. 630 f. ὀξυτόνους
μὲν ᾠδὰς | θρηνήσει, χερόπλακτοι δ’ ἐν
στέρνοισι πεσοῦνται | δοῦποι. For the
transference of the compound epithet cf.
O.C. 711 αὔχημα εὔτιππον, Ai. 55 πολύκερων
φόνον, with ’s notes. — γόους: J.
was inclined to distinguish this as a cognate
ace. from ἠχεῖ τις. κωκυτόν in Track.</p>
<p>866. It is in fact impossible strictly to
separate those uses of the ace. which are
to be considered internal from the ace. of
the direct object: Delbrlick has neatly
marked the transition by his phrase Accusative
of Rusult (Synt. I 376, 382). The
determining consideration is whether or
not the nomen actionis has acquired such
concrete force, as to be regarded as something
external to the agent.

<p>4 ἐξεπομβρῶν is probably right (see
cr. n.), and illustrates the fondness of
Sophocles for ἐΚ in verbal composition
even where, as here, it is added to
another preposition. Cf. ἐξεφίεσθαι Ai.

Phil. 668, ἐξανευρίσκειν ib. 991, ἐξαποφθείρειν

is well illustrated by Cobet, Coll. Crit.
p. 189, who, after giving a long list of
Sophoclean compounds with ἐΚ, remarks
that they differ in no. respect from the
simple verbs, ’ nisi quod simplices formae
toti populo sunt in ore, compositae Diis

an interview, conference with another another'
thus, e.g. in Ar. Eq. 806 καὶ στεμφύλῳ

<p>Nowhere, so far as I know, is it used of
hostile arguments submitted to a judge
for decision. To Dobree the combination
λόγων δίκη seemed absurd ; but it corresponds
to δίκην λέγειν (Ar. Vesp. 777),
and to τοὺς ἀναγκαίους διὰ λόγων ἀγῶνας
(Gorg. Hel. 13), which refers to a trial
in an Athenian law-court with its formal
speeches on either side. So here: ‘ if Ζ.
should submit himself to trial on this
issue with men, he would be cast.'
λόγων δίκη is the same as λόγων ἀγών
(Eur. Phoen. 588 n., Hclid. 116 n.,
Thuc. 3. 67) ; λόγων ἄμιλλα is a Sophistic
display (Gorg. l.c., Wilamowitz on Eur.
Her. 1255). δίΚη in the forensic sense is
familiar to Sophocles (Ai. 447, Ant. 742) :
cf. ἐς δίκην ἔστην Eur. Ι.Τ. 961 On
this view ὄφλοι is absolute : see Lexx.</p>
<p>6 θνητὸς ἐκ θνητῆς τε φύς : cf. El.
589, Phil. 384, O.T. 1397.</p>
<p>7 εὖ φρονεῖν was current Attic for
‘ to be in one's right mind ’ : Isae. 7. i
(Wyse). So in O.T. 552, 570, 600, 626
Ant. 755. frs. 108, 836. It is difficult to
see how, either in this sense or as ‘to
have good ’ it can be used to limit
σοφώτερος. Herwerden, thinking the
phrase meaningless, suspected that δὖ
φρονεῖν had taken the place of ἀξθίτου,
but subsequently was content to pronounce
the line corrupt. Blaydes, reading πῶς
δῆτα θνητός τ’ ὢν ἐγώ in v. ὁ, substituted
ἂν φρονεῖν for εὖ φρονεῖν. Wecklein suggested
προφέρτερος for σοφώτερος.
Perhaps the inf. is an error for εὖ
φρονῶν (fr. 462 n.) : ’How should Ι. . .
while of sound mind, aspire to be wiser
than Zeus ? ’ A moderate ambition is
the counterpart of a sound intelligence.

of the words shows that κακῶν is governed
by ἐνδυτήριος, as if κακά were the
material of the envelopment, ‘ shrouding

analogy of πλήρης, πολυστεφής Ο.Τ. 83),

Blaydes unwarrantably proposes ἐνδυτὴρ
λύσει (or ἄρχει, with δ’ for σ’). ἐνδυτήριος

related (as e.g. σωτήριος to σωτήρ) to
ἐνδυτήρ, which occurs only in Trach. 674.</p>
<p>It expresses therefore (see ’s note in

<p>The subject of the play is unknown, and Welcker (p. 159)
took the view that the citations of the title were errors arising
from the appearance of Priam as a character in some one or
other of the Trojan plays. For examples of this kind of
mistake see § i. Here, however, there is a prima
facie case in favour of the title ; and there is no reason why
Sophocles should not have composed a Priam, as Philocles did
(Suid.). One might guess that the plot related either (i) to the
visit of Priam to Achilles in order to ransom the body of Hector,
described in Hom. Ω and dramatized by Aeschylus in his Φρύγες
ἢ Ἕκτορος λύτρα (TGF p. 84), or (2) to the slaughter of Priam
by Neoptolemus at the altar of Zeu? ‘Ερκεῖος, an incident of the
sack of Troy contained in the Ἰλίου πέρσις of Arctinus, if not

<p>The custom of exposing children in
earthenware pots may be illustrated by
Ar. Ran. 1190 ὅτε δὴ πρῶτον μὲν αὐτὸν
γενόμενον (sc. Oedipus) | χειμῶνος ὄντος
ἐξέθεσαν ἐν ὀστράκῳ | ἵνα μὴ κτραφεὶς

δ’ εἰσέφερε γραῦς ἐν χύτρᾳ τὸ παιδίον, Hdt.
1. 113 ἔθηκε ἐς τὸ ἄγγος, ἐν τῷ ἔφερε τὸν
ἕτερον παῖδα). Hence χυτρίζειν and
ἐγχυτρίζειν, for which we have the testimony
of the grammarians: Hesych. iv
p. 302 χυτρίζειν· ἐν χύτρᾳ τιθέναι,
schol. Ar. Ran. 1190, Hesych. 11 p. 13
ἐγχυτρίζειν· ἐκτθέναι βρέφος ἐν χύτρᾳ.
From schol. Plat. Min. 315 c ( = Suid.,
Etyni. Μ. s.v.) we get the information
that ἐγχυτρίστιαι was the name given to
the nurses who carried out the task of
exposure. As we see from Herodotus
that it was customary to use the same
kind of pot for burying a dead child as
for exposing it, this may explain an
obscure statement in the last-mentioned
authorities : ἔλεγον δὲ καὶ τὸ βλάψαι καταχυτρίσαι,
ὡς Ἀριστοφάνης, where Lobeck
restored θάψαι. Welcker referred the
allusion to the exposure of Paris.</p>
<p>ΠΡΟΚΡΙΣ</p> 
<p>The famous story of the loves of Cephalus and Procris is
told with many variations ; and the elaborate and romantic
version contained in Ovid Met. 7. 690 — 862, is a conglomerate
combining the legends of the Teumesian fox, of the love of
Aurora for Cephalus, of the hound which could outrun any fourfotted
beast, and of the spear which never missed its aim, with
the simplest form of the original love-story. A similar remark
applies to the accounts given by Apollod. 3. 197 f, Anton.
Lib. 41, and Hygin. fab. 189. The visit of Procris to Minos in
Crete, and the coarseness of the device by which she revenged
herself upon Cephalus, are hardly likely to have been introduced
by Sophocles into his play. The original form of the Attic
myth is probably to be found in Pherecydes (FHG I 90), as
recorded by the schol. on Hom. X 321 : see also Eustath. Od.
p. 1688, 20. Cephalus, the son of Deioneus, married Procris,
the daughter of Erechtheus, and dwelt in Thoricus. Wishing

<pb n="171"/>
to test his wife's fidelity, he remained abroad for a period of
eight years, and at length returned to his own house in disguise.
Then, by a profusion of rich gifts, he set himself to seduce
Procris ; and, when at last he seemed to be on the point of
success, he revealed his identity and rebuked his wife. A reconciliation
followed ; but the unremitting ardour with which
Cephalus devoted himself to the chase, aroused the suspicion of
Procris that he was secretly courting another woman. Her suspicion
was confirmed by a conversation with a servant, who
admitted that in a lonely spot on the mountain he had frequently
heard his master exclaim: ὦ νεφέλη, παραγενοῦ. Procris
determined to conceal herself at the place indicated, and to
await the issue. So, when she heard him repeating the cry, she
ran towards him ; but Cephalus, amazed at her sudden appearance,
before he could recognize who she was, threw his javelin
and killed her. Subsequently he sent for her father Erechtheus
and gave her a splendid burial.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the story agrees with a vase-painting
reproduced by Rapp in Roscher II iioi from MiWingen, Ancient
unedited Monuments, fig. 14, which represents Procris transfixed
by a spear, Cephalus on one side holding a hound by a leash,
and Erechtheus arriving on the other. Although there is no
evidence respecting the contents of Sophocles' play, it seems
fairly certain that the accidental death of Procris must have been
the climax of the action : τὰ δ' ἐς τὴν Πρόκριο, says Pausanias
(10. 29. ὁ), καὶ οἱ πάντες ᾄδουσιν. . .ὃν τρόπον ἐτελεύτησεν ὑπὸ
τοὐ ἀνδρός.</p>
<p>It should be added that the trial of Cephalus for homicide
before the court of the Areopagus was a familiar Athenian legend
(schol. Eur. Or. 1649); and it might be argued that Sophocles
was hardly likely to have omitted to refer to it. In that case the
sole fragment that has been preserved was possibly taken from
a description of the judges.</p>

neutral ‘ ’ ‘ appraiser’) ; but there
is no doubt that, like ἐπιτίμιον (J ebb on

tone, to which βαρύς points. Strictly an
assessor of penalties, in the metaphorical
sense it is perhaps best represented by
’censurer.’</p>

<p>The statement of Macrobius (fr. 534) shows that the play
dealt with the magic practices of Medea, and, in view of the
events covered by the other plays relating to the fortunes of
Jason and Medea Κολχίδες, Σκύθαι), Welcker's inference 1 that
the plot comprised the cunning artifice by which Medea persuaded
the daughters of Pelias to destroy their father's life has
been generally accepted. The title clearly indicates the gathering
of medicinal or magical herbs ; for ῥιζοτόμος was applied as well
to those whom we should call sorcerers as to the legitimate
followers of Asclepius. Cf Theophr. h.p. 4. 5. i τὰ φαρμακώδη
ταῖς ῥίζαις καὶ τοῦ ὀποῖς. . .σχεδὸν πάντα τὰ ῥιζοτομούμενα, ib. 9.

ῥιζῶν πόας· καλοῦσι γὰρ καὶ πόαν ἔνια τῶν φαρμακωδῶν οἱ ῥιζοτόμοι.
(It was a very improbable guess of Μ. Schmidt that the
gloss of Hesych. II p. 549 κυκλάμινος· πόα τις ὑπὸ τῶν ῥιξοτόμων
referred to the play of Sophocles.) Phot. lex. p. 488, 19 ῥιζοτόμοι·
φαρμακεῖς· βοτανικοί. Lucian dial. d. 13. I (Heracles to Asclepius)

to Medea herself in Ov. Met. 7. 226 et placitas (herbas) partim
radice revellit, | partim succidit curvamine falcis aenae 2. Cf
ib. 264 illic Haemonia radices valle resectas | seminaque floresque

<p>Euripides treated the same subject in his Peliades (TGF
p. 550), which belonged to the year 455, and was the first play
produced by its author. There is nothing to show the date of
the present play, and the fragments give no indication from which
we can trace the development of the plot. The dramatic versions
of the story no doubt contributed to its popularity in later times,
but the allusions of Pindar (Pyth. 4. 251 τὰν Πελίαο φονόν) and
Pherecydes (FHG 1 87 ὡς ἔλθοι Μήδεια τῷ πελίᾳ κακόν) are
enough to prove that it was not invented by the tragic poets 3.
The rejuvenation of Aeson was mentioned in the Cyclic Nosti
(EGF p. 55), and that of Jason himself by Pherecydes (FHG
189) and Simonides (fr. 204) 4.</p>
<p>During the absence of the Argonauts Pelias had put Jason's
father Aeson to death, or had forced him to commit suicide by
drinking ’s blood. Whereupon his wife Amphinome had
hanged herself in grief, or, according to another version, had

<pb n="173"/>
fled to the royal hearth and there stabbed herself, cursing Pelias
as the author of her sorrows. Even Promachus, Jason's younger
brother, who was still a child, had been slain, in order that no
possible successor to the throne might be left. When the
Argonauts reached Thessaly on their return, Medea determined
to avenge her ’s wrongs. Accordingly, disguising herself
as an aged priestess of Artemis, she managed to effect an entrance
into the palace. She then announced to the king that the goddess
regarded him with special favour, and had come in person
to give him renewed youth. By various magical tricks, and in
particular by secretly removing her disguise, and showing herself
as a young and beautiful woman, she won the confidence of
Pelias and his daughters. The latter were ready to do anything
she bade them, and when, after cutting up and boiling an old
ram, she pretended to produce in its place a lamb from the
cauldron, she had no difficulty in persuading them all — with the
exception of Alcestis — to take the same course with their father.
While Pelias was thus being done to death, Medea lighted
a torch on the roof of the palace as a signal to the Argonauts,
who were waiting in concealment outside. Then Jason, with the
help of his companions, seized the royal stronghold. Eventually,
however, he surrendered the throne to Acastus, the son of Pelias,
and withdrew to Corinth.</p>
<p>This narrative is principally taken from Diod. 4. 50—53
should be compared with the accounts given in Apollod. i. 143 f.,
Hygin. fab. 24, Pausan. 8. 1 1. 2, and Ov. Met. 7. 207 — 349. Thus
Ovid and Pausanias make Medea present herself to Pelias as
a suppliant, complaining of the wrongs she had suffered from
Jason. But ’s attempt to assign the version of Diodorus
to Euripides, and that of Ovid to Sophocles, cannot be supported.
Ovid and Hyginus entirely omit the motives which served to
excuse the cruelty of the revenge taken ; but it is incredible
that Sophocles took no account of this tragic element in the,
story. The cruelty of Pelias is recorded by Diodorus and
Apollodorus; but the narrative of Diodorus is known to be based
on the prose romance of Dionysius Scytobrachion (c. 150 B.C.:
Schwartz in Pauly-Wissowa V 930), and contains several incidents
which can hardly have come from an Attic tragedian 1. There is
thus no evidence which we can safely use in reconstructing the
<note type="footnote">1 Welcker, however, attributed this version to Sophocles. Robert, ArcA. Ztg.
1875, p. 134, referred it to the Peliades. On the other hand, Schwartz, de Dionys.
Scytobr. p. 9, supposed that Ovid derived his material from Euripides, and that

plot of Sophocles ; but the unanimity of the authorities in
stating that the boiling of the ram was the device which prevailed
with the Peliades, makes it highly probable that it was
used by both tragic poets. Welcker thinks that both in Sophocles
and Euripides the climax was reached when Medea signalled
to Jason from the roof of the palace—a guess probable
but unsupported by evidence. He also conjectures that the
action of the play began with ’s herb-gathering, and that
the introductory matter was explained in a narrative prologue.</p>
<p>It may be questioned whether the chorus of ῥιζοΤόμοι was
composed simply of attendants of Medea, or comprised the
’s daughters and other maidens from lolcus.

<p>6 ἀλαλαζομένη : see cr. n. Nauck
(Index, p. XI 11) accepted Ellendt's conjecture.
ἀλαλή is the joyous cry of
victory, and is associated in consequence
with the gods who are supreme in war
(Pind. fr. 225 Ἀλαλά, Πολέμου θύγατερ),
such as Ares (Cornut. 21) and Athena
(Pind. Ol. 7. 37). It is true that in
general the ἀλαλαγμός of men answers to
the ὀλολυγμός of women : Heliod. 3. 5
ὠλόλυξαν μὲν αἱ γυναῖκες, ἠλάλαξαν δ’
οἱ ἄνδρες, on the occasion of a procession
at Delphi in honour of Neoptolemus.
But, if the circumstances so required,
the more sonorous cry might be uttered
by women: Eur. Bacch. 11 33 αἲ δ’ ἠλάλαζον,
of the infuriated Bacchaiaals. The
word is more particularly connected with
the strange sounds heard in the wild rites
of non- Hellenic deities, such as Cybele
(Eur. Hel. 1352) and Cotytto (Aesch. fr.
57), or with portentous and supernatural
voices (Hdt. 8. 37). Hence we find
ἀλαγμός etc. used in Plutarch of
the cries of lost souls (ser. num. vind.
22 p. 564 B, fac. orb. lun. 29 p. 944 B), of
mourning women (consol. 7 p. 610 C), and
of the distracted ravings of Marius (Mar.
45). ἀλαλάζεσθαι, therefore, does not appear
to be out of place when applied to
the sorceress Medea in her invocation of
Hecate (cf. fr. 535). It must be admitted
that ὀλολύζειν is used by Ap. Rh. 3. 1215
of the nymphs accompanying Hecate,
and ululare by Hor. Sat. i. 8. 25, Ov.
Met. 7. 190: but some confusion of the
two words was inevitable, and we are
not justified in altering the text.</p>

<p>1 ff. κτἑ. ‘ Thou hallowed fire,
weapon of Hecate the road-goddess, that
she bears when ministering in Olympus
on high and in her haunts by the sacred
cross-ways on ’ There can be no
doubt that Sophocles here connects
Hecate with Helios as the moon-goddess,
while at the same time recognizing the
other (chthonian) aspect of her power
(v. 4). In both capacities she wields
the torch, to which are to be referred her
titles Φωσφόρος (Eur. Hel. 569 n.), δᾳδοφόρος
(Jebb on Bacchyl. fr. 23) and the
like. Most of the authorities (e.g.
Stending in Roscher i 1888) treat this
function as the natural attribute of a
lunar goddess; but Farnell (Cults of
Greek States, ii p. 549) thinks that the
torch was originally a chthonian symbol.
See also Heckenbach in Pauly-
Wissowa VII 2777. Similarly Artemis
was ἀμφίπυρος (Trach. 216, cf. Ο.Τ.
206) : the double torch is explained by
Wiener (Rh. Mus. LVIII 333) as referring
to the division of the month into two
halves. — εἰνοδίας, as a title of Hecate,
is for the most part associated with
chthonian worship: see Jebb on Ant.
1 199. Possibly it was suggested by fear
of brigands: Heckenbach, l.c. 2775. Cf.
Eur. Hel. 570 οὐ νυκτίφαντον πρόπολον
ἐνοδίας μ’ ὁρᾷς (n.), Ion 1048 Εἰνοδία. . .ἃ
τῶν νθκτιπόλων ἐφόδων ἀνάσσεις. — ἔγχος,
weapon, is applied somewhat vaguely to
the torch, as an instrument borne by
Hecate in the exercise of her sacred
function: see on fr. 782. — προπολοῦσα :
seecr. n. The common reading is Keil's
πωλοῦσα, of which J. says: ‘ πωλέω, to
go about trading (and so simply “ to
sell ”), here reverts to its primitive sense,
going about, ’ But there is no
authority for the meaning required. My
suggestion rests on the assumption that
Hecate was the minister of Zeus in
Olympus (Ar. Ran. 1362 av δ’ ὦ, Διὸς
διπύρους ἀνέχουσα λαμπάδας ὀξυτάτας
χεροὶν Ἑκάτα), and of Persephone in the
world below : Hom. A. Dem. 439 f. πολλὰ
δ’ ἄρ' ἀμφαγάπησε κόρην Δημήτερος
ἁγνῆς· Ι ἐΚ τοῦοὶ πρόπολος καὶ ὀπάων
ἔπλετ' ἄνασσα. Discussing ‘ the Hesiodic
’ (Hes. Th. 411 ff.) in C.R. XII
392, G. C. W. Warr inferred that ’her
special participation in sacrificial offerings
to the gods must be explained in the
sense that offerings were made through
her to greater deities, whose servant she
was.' — τριόδους: ‘ she was the goddess of
the cross- ways not necessarily because if
we travel by night the moonlight is desirable
when we come to them, but very
possibly because she was the mistress of
ghosts, and the cross- ways were ’

<p>Ellendt appears to be right in understanding
κόρον as a waxen puppet or doll
fashioned to represent the victim, which
the sorcerer melts in the fire in order to
make his magic influence effective. But,
when he flatly asserts that the κόρος
represents Jason, who is bewitched by
Medea, he overlooks the gender of the
participle. This meaning of κόρος (not
recognized by L. and S.) is implied in
κοροπλάθος, and the word itself is found
in Suid. s.v. κοροπλάθοι· οἱ τοὺς κόρους
πλάττοντες κηρῷ ἢ γύψῳ = Timaeus, ed.
Ruhnk. p. 165. So Harpocr. s.v. κοροπλάθος,
who gives κόρας ἢ κόρους, and
Ruhnken shows that κόρη is better at
tested. Küster's κηρόν gives the
sense, and in that case αἰστώσας is required,
a form which might he justified
by Ai. 515 σὺ γάρ μοι πατρίδ' ᾔστωσας
δορί. Duentzer, who refers to Pind. fr.
123, ὁ, thinks that the melting of
wax was introduced to symbolize the
wasting power of love. But the change
does not seem to be necessary. Brunck
strangely preferred κόρην with the explanation
planation ‘ de Jasone, qui Medeam urebat.᾿
Still less attractive is Hartung's
κορμῶν.</p>
<p>The magical practice in which a waxen
image is burnt or stabbed, either as a
love-charm or in order to cause death or
sickness, is sufficiently well known. Cf.
Theocr. 2. 28 ὡς τοῦτον τὸν Κηρὸν ἐγὼ
σὺν δαίμονι τήΚω, | ὣς τάκοιθ' ὑπ’ ἔρωτος
ὁ Μύνδιος αὐτίκα Δέλφις. Such are
Plato's κήρινα μιμήματα πεπλασμένα
(legg. 933 B). So Hor. Epod. 17. 76
cereas imagines, Sat. 1. 8. 30, Verg. Ecl.
8. 76. Ov. Her. ὁ. 91 devovet absentes
simulacraque eerea fingit, et miserum
tenues in ieeur urget aeus. The medieval
witches went through exactly the same
ceremonies. A graphic account is given
in ’s Chronicle of the be-
witching of King Duffe : ‘ who found
one of the Witches resting upon a
woodden broche an image of waxe at
the fire, resembling in ech feature the
kings person, made and devised as is to
be thought, by craft and art of the Devill:
an other of them sat reciting certain
words of enchantment, and still basted
the image with a certain licour very
busily ’ (History of Scotland, vi p. 207).
Although, as already observed, the words
of the fragment cannot apply directly to
Medea, it is natural of suppose that her
sorceries are actually in question.</p>
<p>ΣΑΛMΩΝΠΣ ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚOΣ</p>
<p>Salmoneus was an Aeolid, brother of Sisyphus, Athamas,
and Cretheus (Apollod. i. 51), and father of Tyro (Horn. λ 235
p. II.
12</p>

<pb n="178"/>
<p>Apollod. I. 99). Originally a Thessalian, he migrated to Elis,
where he founded the town known as Salmone (Steph. Byz.
p. 552, 5, Strabo 356), or Salmonia (Diod. 4. 68) in Pisatis 1. Cf.
Eur. fr. Ἕλλην γάρ, ὡς λέγουσι, γίγνεται Διός, Ι τοῦ Αἴολος
παῖς, Αἰόλου δὲ Σίσυφος | Ἀθάμας τε Κρηθεύς θ' ὅς τ' ἐπ
Ἀλφειοῦ ῥοαῖς | μανεὶς ἔρριψε Σαλμωνεὺς φλόγα. He was
a typical ὑβριστής, and was punished for his insolent presumption
in aspiring to be the equal of Zeus. In a literal sense he violated
’s precept μὴ μάτευε Ζεὺς γενέσθαι Ιsth. 4. 14).</p>
<p>Salmoneus claimed to be Zeus himself, and ordered the
sacrifices to be made to him which were usually reserved for
Zeus. He even mocked the divine attributes by fastening to his
chariot tanned hides and brazen bowls so contrived as to imitate
the noise of thunder, and by copying the lightning with blazing
torches hurled into the sky. But Zeus struck him with his bolt,
and destroyed his city and all its inhabitants (Apollod. i. 89
cf. Hygin. fab. 61).</p>
<p>Vergul’s allusion to him (Aen. 6. 585 ff.) must be quoted in
full:
<lg><l>vidi et crude dantem Salmonea poenaSy</l>
<l>dum fiammas lovis et sonitus imitatur Olympi 2.</l>
<l>quattuor hic invectus equis et lampada quassans</l>

<l>at pater omnipotens densa inter nubila telum</l>
<l>contorsit, non ille faces nec fumea taedis</l>
<l>lumina, praecipitemque immani turbine adegit.</l></lg>
What aere mesint in v. 591 is doubtful; and some have inclined
to the view that a brazen bridge was intended, as also by Manilius
(5. 91 ff.). Anyhow, it is clear that Vergil did not follow
the same authority as Apollodorus. The legend was known to
Hesiod in some form; for he calls Salmoneus ἄδικος (fr. 7, 5 Rz.).
Eustath. Od. p. 1681, 63, denying that the impiety of Salmoneus
was known to Homer, ascribes its notoriety to οἱ νεώτεροι.</p>
<p>There is no trace of dramatic action in the story of Salmoneus
so far as it is known to us ; but the sources are none too copious.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 For the historical significance of this see Wilamowitz, Isyllos, p. 10 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 The commentators have discovered extraordinary subtleties of meaning in dtim
imitatur, because they refuse to face the facts. Let anyone consider Cic. Tusc. i.
10 1 dic, hospes, Sparine nos te hie vidisse iaeentes, | dum sanctis patriae legibus obsequimur;
and, even without the help of the original, ὦ ξεῖν', ἀγγέλλειν Λακεδαιμονίοις
ὅτι τηδε Ι κείμεθα, κείνων Κείνων ῥήμασι πειθόμενοι, he might see that dum obsequimur
was simply ‘ obedient.’ ’ So here dum imitatur= ‘as an imitator ’ The clause is
no longer temporal, and defies translation ; but a full discussion would lead too far.</note>

<p>Robert 1 has recently referred to the play of Sophocles for the
interpretation of a much-disputed vase-painting. It was originally
published by E. A. Gardner in Α. J. Arch. 1899, ill 331, and
explained by him as depicting the madness of Athamas. Subsequently,
at the suggestion of Miss Harrison made independently
of Robert, it was referred to Salmoneus by A. B. Cook in C.R.
XVII 276, where a reproduction is given. But Cook did not
bring in Sophocles. Robert supposes that Salmoneus was put
in chains by his subjects as a madman 2, and was represented
brandishing his sham thunderbolt, after he had broken loose.
Even if it were certain, the identification would not carry us far.</p>
<p>Anthropologists seem to be agreed that Salmoneus was
originally a rain-maker, and that his action was afterwards misunderstood:

delabrum (ῥάβδος), is surrounded at a 
third of its height by a basin, and in a

with one leg and arm raised (the μάνης).

case of hypallage, like efesta Jiabra aquilnum
(Lucr. 5. 742). On such transferences
of the epithet see Headlam in
C.R. XVI 434. This consideration also
serves to justify δυσοσμίας to which
Kepavvias should logically be attached :
thus there is no need for Madvig's prosaic
συσοσμία, or for Nauck's δυσομβρίας.

<p>The words irdo-av ὄψιν cannot be explained

<p>ΣΙΝΩΝ</p>
<p>Aristotle mentions a Sinon — presumably the play of Sophocles
— amongst the tragedies which were drawn from the Little Iliad
(poet. 23. 1459 b 7). If Proclus is to be trusted, the Little Iliad
broke off at the point where the Trojans resolved to drag the
Wooden Horse into the city, and the Iliupersis began with the
debate as to what should be done with it 1. Although Sinon is
only named in connexion with the Iliupersis, as having entered
the city in a feigned character, and afterwards lighted a torch to
summon back the Greeks from Tenedos (EGF p. 49), it would

<pb n="182"/>
seem that he must have had a place in both poems, as the order
of the narrative in Apollodorus (epit. 5. 15, 19) suggests. Moreover,
Tzetzes on Lycophr. 344 quotes a line of Lesches (fr. 1 1 K.),
in referring to the occasion when Sinon held up the torch after
having persuaded the Trojans by his cunning to drag the horse
into the city. But it is sufficient for the present purpose to know
that Sophocles undoubtedly derived the story of Sinon from the
epic Cycle.</p>
<p>The nature of the stratagem by which Sinon induced the
Trojans to compass their own ruin is familiar to every one from
’s description (Aen. 2. 57 — 194); and need not be recapitulated
here. How far Vergil, when composing Sinon's eloquent
appeal, may have used the Sophoclean model, it is impossible to
say ; but Heyne long since recognized that the speech was instinct
with the spirit of Attic tragedy 1. In v. 256 Vergil follows
a version which differs from the old tradition, by making the
ship of Agamemnon light a flare on the return from Tenedos as
a signal for Sinon to open the horse. This corresponds with the
passage in Aen. 6. 518, where Helen holds up a torch on the
acropolis as a signal to Agamemnon 2. Hygin. fab. 108 seems to
follow Vergil; but Quint. 13. 23, Diet. 5. 12, and Tzetz. Posthom.
721 all agree with the version of the Cycle.</p>
<p>According to Serv. Verg. Aen. 2. 79 and Tzetz. Lycophr. 344
Sinon was son of Aesimus, grandson of Autolycus and Amphithea,
and so, through Anticlea, a first cousin of Odysseus.
Holzinger on Lycophr. l.c. thinks that the genealogy was at least
as old as Sophocles. Tiimpel, on the other hand (Pauly-Wissowa
II 1085, 1957), regards it as due to a confusion by the mythographer
of the Homeric Amphithea with the wife of Tennes.
But the tradition is clearly older than Lycophron, who must
have had some authority for calling Sinon Σισυφεία κίναδος.
Maass in Herm. XVII 618 conjectured that the name Sinon was
a shortened form of Sinopos, the eponymous founder of Sinope.</p>
<p>Quintus (12. 353 ff.) differs from the Vergilian account by
making Sinon submit to mutilation and torture at the hands of
the Trojans before he will consent to reveal his story. But,
according to Tryphiod. 219 ff., Sinon voluntarily allowed his
body to be disfigured with wounds before the Greeks departed 3,

versions : in the Little Iliad, in which he gave his signal from the tomb of Achilles,
and therefore did not enter the city, Sinon played an entirely subordinate part. See
also Bethe in Rh. Mus. XLVI 518 ff., who conjectures that the increased importance
of Sinon was due to Sophocles.</note>

choose between them. Eur. Tro. 344
ἀναιθύσσεις φλόγα might seem to support
the compound ; but this counts for little
in the case of so rare a word, and there

<pb n="184"/>
<p>The punishment of Sisyphus ( Horn. λ 593 etc.) is better known
than the crime for which he was condemned. But in the play
the fate of Sisyphus in Hades can only have been mentioned in
the concluding scene. For the main course of the action we are
left to choose between various accounts of his offence, (i) He
is said to have betrayed the plans of the gods (Serv. on Verg.
Aen. 6. 616); but that is perhaps only a generalization from
(2) the story that Sisyphus blabbed to Asopus that Zeus had
carried off his daughter Aegina (Apollod. i. 85 etc.). (3) Hyginus
(fab. 60) states that he was punished propter impietatein.
Sisyphus, in feud with his brother Salmoneus, was told by Apollo
that, if his ’s daughter Tyro should bear children to him,
they would avenge him on Salmoneus. But Tyro, hearing of
their destiny, destroyed the children whom Sisyphus had begotten.
A lacuna in the text prevents us from discovering the
crime of which Sisyphus was subsequently guilty. But these
stories are not characteristic of the knavish cunning for which the
name of Sisyphus became a by-word: see on fr. 567. Even in
Homer he was κέρδιστος ἀνδρῶν (Z 153). (4) Pherecydes
191), after giving the same account as Apollodorus of the original
offence, makes Zeus punish Sisyphus in the first place by sending
Death to him. Sisyphus seized Death, and put him in chains,
so that no one died, until Ares released Death and handed over
Sisyphus to him. But Sisyphus was not at the end of his resources
; for he commanded his wife Merope to omit the usual
funeral rites. Accordingly, when Sisyphus was in Hades, and
the offerings due to the gods of the nether world were withheld,
he persuaded Persephone to let him go back to earth and punish
his wife for her neglect. But, when he got home, he refused
to return, until he was ultimately dragged back by force: see
schol. Soph. Phil. 625 κἀξ Ἅιδου θανὼν | πρὸς φῶς ἀνελθεῖν,
ὥσπερ οὑκείνου πατήρ — a passage which favours the conclusion
that these incidents were comprised in the plot οφ the Sisyphus.
The story was known to Theognis (702 ff.): πλείονα δ' εἰδείης
Σισύφου Αἰολίδεω, Ι εστε καὶ ἐξ Ἀίδεω πολυιδρίῃσιν ἀνῆλθεν,
TretVa? Περσεφόνην αἱμυλίοισι λόγοις. Its dramatic possibilities
are obvious, and the title Σίσυφος δραπέτης indicates that
it formed the subject of a satyr-play of Aeschylus (TGF
p. 74). It is uncertain whether the Σίσυφος πετροκυλιστής (ibid.)
was a separate play; but, though regarded by Welcker (Nachtr.
p. 316) as a tragedy, its satyric character seems to be established1.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Fr. 233 is probably decisive, since the ‘ Aetnaean beetle’ is essentially a
touch (Soph. fr. 162) Wilamowitz, Horn. Unters. p. 202, doubts the authenticity of
the story attributed to Pherecydes.</note>

<pb n="185"/>
<p>Euripides wrote a satyric Sisyphus produced with the Troades in
415 B.C. (Aelian var. hist. 2. 8). There was also a play by
Critias so entitled ( TGF p. 771). Welcker (p. 402) thought
the solitary quotation from the Sisyphus of Sophocles was an
error, and that the intention was to refer to Aeschylus. This is
an opinion that can neither be proved nor refuted.</p>
<p>It should be added that Aristotle, taking Sisyphus as the
typical example of the defeat of a clever rogue, regards the
subject as τραγικὸν καὶ φιλάνθρωπον (poet. 18. 1456 a 21).</p>

<p>The compound, so far as it goes beyond
the idea of ‘three,’ implies a trinity

it may point to a closer union here than
when applied to Hera, Athena, and
Aphrodite in Eur. Hel. 357 (n.). τριζυ-
γέες Χάριτες occurs also in Macedonius
(c. 550 A.D.), A.P. II. 27 The force of
the compound is similar to σιστόλους

metaphor see on fr. 511. On the number
of the Charites see Pausan. 9. 35. 1, who
says that the institution of the cult of
three Graces at Orchomenos was
ditionally ascribed to Eteocles. The
earliest allusion to them in literature is
Hes. Theog. 907. Miss Harrison
Proleg. p. 286 ff. discusses the development
of this and other maiden-trinities : cf.

were always recognized at Athens:

<p>ΣΚΥΘΑΙ</p>
<p>The contents of the fragments show that the play was concerned
with the expedition of the Argonauts. WElcker 1 called
attention to a statement of the grammarian Sergius, explan. in
Donat. Gramm. Lat. IV. p. 490, 21 Keil : aliam scripsit Medeani
Sophocles, item in alio furoris actu aliam Etcripides, aliam diversi
scriptores. ergo non de illis Medeis sentimus, quae occiderunt filios
stios, quasi multae sint, sed de illis quae scriptae sunt per varios
auctores. From this he drew the inference that in the Σκύθαι
Medea was delineated as frenzied owing to the faithlessness of
her lover, since in the other plays in which she appeared
Κολχίδες and Ῥιζοτόμοι) she had no occasion to exhibit this
<note type="footnote">1 p. 337 ff.</note>

<pb n="186"/>
passion; and further, that the situation must have been analogous
to that of the fourth book of Apollonius, where the
Colchians under the leadership of Apsyrtus overtook the Argonauts,
and Medea treacherously betrayed her brother's life to
Jason. Nauck thinks that the grammarian invented a Medea of
Sophocles for his own purposes; but, even if he did follow some
genuine tradition, his words are too vague to justify any inference
concerning the plot of the Scythae. In any case, it is certain
that the story of Sophocles cannot have been the same as that
of Apollonius. For (i) fr. 546 shows that in the play Apsyrtus
was still a child; and (2) fr. 547 (n.) that the geographical conditions
assumed by Apollonius were entirely different from those
in Sophocles.</p>
<p>Is there, then, any evidence which will help to determine the
subject ? The locality of the action may surely be inferred from
the title, confirmed as it is by the mention of the Tanais in fr. 548,
and the reference to Achillean barley in fr. 551 (n.) 1. If, then,
some point on the north-west coast of the Euxine was the scene
of the play, we may proceed to enquire what adventure of the
Argonauts is connected with that region. Fr. 546 proves that
the plot cannot have belonged to the outward journey, and we
may therefore leave out of account the arrival at Tauri, where
Perses brother of Aeetes was king, as recorded by Diod. 4. 44.
Inasmuch as we are limited to the homeward voyage, the pursuit
by the Colchians and the death of Apsyrtus, which are variously
related in the different versions, are the only subjects appropriate
to the conditions. Now, the geographical data exclude the version
of Pherecydes (FHG I 89), in which the limbs of Apsyrtus
were thrown into the Phasis, and that of Hyginus (yfab. 26) and
other late authorities, who name Apsaros, a place in the south-east
corner of the Euxine, as the scene of the murder. The story of
Apollodorus (i. 133) and Ovid alone remains, and seems to provide
exactly what is required. Apollodorus relates that, when Medea
saw her ’s ship getting nearer, she slew her brother, and
having cut his body into pieces threw them into the sea. Aeetes
delayed the pursuit in order to collect the limbs ; and then buried
such as he could find at a place to which he gave the name Tomi.
The situation of Tomi, where Ovid remained in banishment, was
on the west coast of the Euxine, not far to the south of the mouth
of the Ister; and Ovid frequently speaks of himself as living
the Scythians (e.g. Trist. 4. 9. 17, Pont. 4. 6. 5). The same neigh-
<note type="footnote">1Nevertheless Vater (Argonautenzug, 11 152) finds the plot in the Phaeacian
episode of ApoU. Rh. 4. 1001 ff. The same considerations apply to Ahrens, who puts
the scene of the action in Greece, and apparently thinks that the plot was similar
to that of Euripides’ Medea.</note>

<pb n="187"/>
bourhood is brought into connexion with the murder of Apsyrtus
by Aelian Παί. an. 14. 25), who speaks of the natives as living on
the boundaries of Scythia, and as engaged in repelling the attacks
of its inhabitants. It will be observed that Apollodorus supposes
that the murder took place on the ship, and that the mutilated
members were thrown into the sea. This proceeding could not
have been represented in a tragedy; and, if reported by a messenger,
would have left insufficient material for the rest of the
action. It is therefore worthy of remark that Ovid speaks of
Apsyrtus' limbs as scattered per agros (Ib. 433, Her. 6. 129, Trist.
3. 9. 27). According to the last-quoted passage, the Argonauts
had landed at the spot afterwards known as Tomi, when the fleet
of Aeetes was seen approaching. Consequently they were obliged
to make a sudden departure, and Medea bethought herself
of the horrid device in order to detain her father. But the same
phrase recurs in Accius (fr. incert. XCIII, from Cic. n. d. 3. 67) :
<lg>
<l>postquam pater</l>
<l>adpropinquat iamque paene ut comprehendatur parat,</l>
<l>pueruni interea optruncat membraque articulatim dividit</l>
<l>perque agros passim dispergit corpus ; id ea gratia,</l>
<l>ut dum nati dissupatos artus captaret parens,</l>
<l>ipsa interea effugeret, illum ut maeror tardaret sequi,</l>
<l>sibi salutem ut familiari pareret parricidio.</l>
</lg></p>
<p>Hence Zöllner (Analecta Ovidiana, p. 48) drew the inference
that Ovid followed the description of Accius, and reconstructed
his Medea on that assumption. Ribbeck (Röm. Trag. p.
had previously suggested on different grounds that the Medea
(or Argonautae) of Accius followed the Scythae of Sophocles;
and it is therefore possible that in Ovid we may find the traces
of Attic tragedy.</p>
<p>The argument may be summed up as follows: (i) there is
no subject which seems so likely for the Scythae as the story
which localized the death of Apsyrtus in Scythia; (2) there are
some indications that Ovid's version of this story was influenced
by earlier dramatic treatment. It is not a legitimate objection
that Sophocles in the Colchides (fr. 343) had represented the
murder as perpetrated within the palace of Aeetes. Certainly
no tragic poet, when writing a new play taken from a legendary
cycle which he had previously used for dramatic purposes, would
have considered himself bound to reproduce exactly every detail
of his earlier narrative.</p>

<p>Valckenaer, diatr. p. 224, restored the
lines as trochaic tetrameters (see cr. n.),
and was obliged in consequence to reject
κοίτης as a gloss. This is possible (see
e.g. schol. on Track. 911). But it is
just as easy (with Bergk) to treat them
as iambics : v. 3 is in any case corrupt,
whether or not Bergk’s insertion of Nεαίρας
is right. J. remarks: ῾It is perhaps
slightly in favour of Bergk’s view that
trochaic tetrameters imply great excitement.
The speaker cannot be Medea
(as Welcker assumes). Who then should
speak thus? Possibly Aeetes, if the fact
that Apsyrtus was only half-brother of
Medea was quoted, not to palliate her
conduct, but as helping to explain why
she had no sisterly feeling for him.᾿
Ribbeck thought that the lines were
spoken by Jason, or one of Medea’s
partisans; and this is perhaps a better
view.</p>
<p>The parentage of Medea and Apsyrtus
is variously recorded. Hes. Theog. 958:
Aeetes, son of Helios, Κούρην Ὠκεανοῖο
τελήεντος ποταμοῖο| γῆμε θεῶν βουλῇσιν
Ἰδυῖαν καλλιπάρῃον, who bore to him
Medea. The author of the Natipactia,
one of the later epics, makes Eurylyte
the wife of Aeetes and mother of Apsyrtus
(frs. 4, 7 Kink.). Apoll. Rhod. 3. 242
makes Asterodeia, a Caucasian nymph,
mother of Apsyrtus, and puts his birth at
a time earlier than the marriage of Aeetes
to Idyia, the youngest daughter of
Oceanus and Tethys. Lycophr. 1024
calls Aeetes Είδυίας πόσιν. Following
the same tradition, Cic. n. d. 3. 48, Ov.
Μ. 11. 232, Apollod. i. 129, Hygin.
fab. 25 speak of Idyia as the mother
of Medea. Tzetzes on Lycophr. 798 and
elsewhere speaks of Idyia as the mother
both of Medea and of Apsyrtus: this,
however, is more likely to be a careless
blunder than to be drawn from an independent
authority.</p>
<p>Αn entirely different legend, which
cannot be traced further back than Dionysius
Scytobrachion (see p. 173), makes
Medea the daughter of Hecate and of
Aeetes, Hecate’s uncle: see Diod. 4. 45,
schol. Ap. Rh. 3. 200 (FHG 118).</p>
<p>Leaving out of account the last-mentioned
version, we find traces of two
different stories, according as Apsyrtus
was represented to be older or younger
than his half-sister. Of these Apollonius
adopted the one, and Sophocles the
other: see on fr. 343. The use of ἄρτι
contrasted with πρίν ποτε shows that here,
as in the Colchidks, Apsyrtus was represented
as a child. It is generally considered
that schol. Ap. Rh. 3. 242 (fr.
344) is an inexact reference to the present
passage. The schol., however, distinctly
states that Sophocles made Neaera the
mother of Medea; and for aught we
know to the contrary, the account in the
Colchides may have been to that effect.
That Sophocles was not consistent is
perhaps suggested by the words ἐν δὲ τοῖς
Σκύρσις (supr.).</p>
<p>2 κοίτης here = ίconcubitus, in which
sense the plural is more common, as was
pointed out by Verrall on Eur. Μed. 434.</p>
<p>3 βλάστεσκε and βλαστάνεσκε (see
cr. n.) are alike unexampled. Dobree,
who thought the passage came from a
chorus, wished to read βλάσταν εἶχε or
ἔσχε, comparing Ο.C. 972. Bergk, who
inserted Neaipas and accepted βλαστάνεσκε,
ended the line with τὴν δ᾿, an
elision also found in Ο.Τ. 29, O.C. ι17,
and elsewhere in Sophocles. But βλαστάνεσκε
cannot stand after ἔβλαστον.
Headlam (Ο.Κ. ΧΙΙΙ 4) conjectured τέκνον
Νεαίρας, ἣν Ἰδυῖα πρίν ποτε | . . . Ὠκεανοῦ

oὖσ᾿ ἔτικτεν.</p>
<p>4 Εἰδυῖα was altered to Ἰδυῖα (Hesiod,
l.c.) by Valckenaer for metrical reasons.
In the present state of our knowledge it
seems better to follow the Mss. — ἔτικτεν :
for the prodelision see on Eur. Hel. 263
and for the error in the order of the
words on fr. 126. Nauck was not justified
in requiring τίκτει : either
stand, just as in English we might say
indifferently ‘was’ or ‘is the mother.’

<p>The earliest version of the Argonautic
voyage made the heroes return through
the Phasis to the Oceanus, and thence
southwards to the Red Sea and Libya.
This seems to have been the account
adopted by Hesiod (fr. 63, 64 Rz.).
When it was discovered that the Phasis
did not communicate with the eastern
sea, it was currently held that the Argonauts
returned by the same course as they
had chosen for their outward journey: cf.
Eur. Med. 432, 1263. But, inasmuch
as it became impossible to ignore the
traces of their expedition left by the
Argonauts in Africa, later accounts brought
them back to the Mediterranean Sea from
the west. This was effected either by
the adoption of a tradition that they
sailed up the Tanais to its source, and
thence carried their vessel on their
shoulders to the shore of the northern
ocean (Diod. 4. 56) ; or in accordance
with the version popularized by Apollonius,
which rested on the belief that the
Danube was divided into two branches
and descended by the western of them
into the Adriatic Sea. See in this connexion

belong to the previous gloss, which runs
thus : Ἀχίλλειον πλάκα (Tr. fr.

λεγομένην.</p>
<p>It is not directly stated, but is surely
to be inferred, that the Achillean cakes
were made of barley imported to Athens
from the north coast of the Euxine,
where the cult of Achilles prevailed from
the mouth of the Ister to the Tauric
Chersonese, and particularly in connexion
with the island Λευκή and the Ἀχιλλέως
δρόμοι: see for the details Escher in
Pauly-Wissowa i 223 f. And perhaps
even the gloss λευκῶν is not without significance:
the white Achillean barley
suggested the white island of Achilles.
As an argument tending in the same
direction it may be added that an allusion
to Achillean bafley grown in the neighbourhood
of the Pontus would be especially
appropriate to the scene of the
Scythae. ἀχιλληίδες was the name given
to the Ἀχίλλειοι κριθαί, and ἀχιλλεῖα to
the barley meal (ἄλφιτα): see Βekk.

<pb n="191"/>
anecd. 474, 7 — 14. Athen. 114 f.
Pherecrates (fr. 130. 4, I 182 K.) also
mentions Ἀχίλλειοι μᾶζαι as a part of
the abundant fare which was provided
for the ancients in the days when Cronos
was king (Cratin. fr. 165, i 64 K.) ; and
Achillean meal was served to those who
were entitled to the privilege of σίτησις
ἐν πρυτανείῳ (schol. Ar. Eq. 819). It
might seem probable therefore that
Bekk. anecd. 474, 14 Ἀχίλλειοι κριθαί· αἱ
εὐτελεῖς should be corrected to εὐγενεῖς
from the text of schol. Ar. Suid. s.v.
Ἀχιλλείων also has κριθῶν καθαρῶν Καὶ
εὐγενῶν, followed by Ἀχίλλειοι κριθαί·
αἱ εὐτελεῖς, where Küster wished
restore εὐγενεῖς. But the difficulty would
in any case remain that the despised
barley-cake appears to be spoken of as
a dainty by the comic poets. So Eustath.
Od. p. 1445, 55 δοκεῖ δὲ τὸ ἄλφιτον εὐτελέστερον

ἔχουσά τι ὡς εἰκὸς ἐξαίρετον. ἦς Ἀχίλλεια
ἐλέγετο τὰ ἄλφιτα. It may be suggested
by way of explanation that the Achillean
cake was honoured as a survival of the
primitive diet rather than prized as a
luxury. σίτησις ἐν πρυτανείῳ would
naturally retain features derived from its
early history (Frazer in J.P. XIV 147 ff.) ;
and in that case we might compare the
spicae adoreae, which the Vestals ground
and cooked (W. Warde Fowler, Roman
Festivals, p. 149), and the barley-cakes
offered in sacrifice at Eleusis (Pausan. i.
38. 6). Eustath. Il. p. 749, 11
that the celebrity of ‘Αchillean’ barleycake
is not to be taken as evidence of
luxury in the heroic age.</p>

reference intended was to the Scythae of
Sophocles.</p>
<p>βυθίζειν, for to sink a ship, became
fairly common in later Greek.</p>
<p>ΣΚΥΡΙΟΙ</p>
<p>The title of this play is generally given as Σκύριοι, but twice
as Σκύριαι by Hesychius. The former is confirmed by CIA II
992 (Marmor Piraeicum): see Wilamowitz, Anal. Eur. P. 157.</p>
<p>Euripides also wrote a Σκύριοι, the subject of which was
undoubtedly the concealment of Achilles by Thetis among the
daughters of Lycomedes, and his discovery through the ingenuity
of Odysseus, when a deputation was sent from the Achaeans
to enquire for him1. Brunck inferred that the Σκύριοι of Sophocles
contained the same subject-matter, and evidently thought
that the citation of Sophocles by the younger Philostratus (fr.
553), in his description of the scene at Scyros when the envoys
arrived from the Greek army, pointed in the same direction.
<note type="footnote">1 Eur. fr. 682 is decisive.</note>

<pb n="192"/>
The latter argument is discounted by the fact that the companion
picture of Neoptolemus at Scyros immediately follows.
Brunck also assigned to Sophocles1 the fragment (Soph. fr. 497 D.
= Tr. fr. adesp. 9 N.2) quoted from the Σκύριοι by Plut. de aud.
poet. 13 p. 34 D (cf de adul. et am. 33 p. 72 E, pseudo-Plut.
pro nobil. 21 [VII p. 274 Bern.]) τὴν δὲ πρὸς τὸν Ἀχιλλέα τὸν ἐν

<l>ξαίεις, ἀρίστου πατρὸς Ἑλλήνων γεγώς ;</l>
</lg>
If one could be certain that the lines were written by Sophocles,
they would of course be decisive as to the nature of the plot.
Brunck found the style suggestive of Sophocles, catching an
echo, I suppose, of Phil. 3 and 1284. But that is commonplace
(Eur. Med. Med. 405, Hclid. 235, Hel. 942, fr. 231, 2) ; and no inference
can be drawn from the use of φῶς. Brunck's suggestion met
with considerable approval, and Welcker2 reconstructed the play
on this basis. He held that fr. 557 was addressed by Diomed
to Lycomedes3 — inappropriately enough ; for what have we to
do with the death of Tydeus ? Dindorf and Ahrens followed
Brunck, and Nauck agreed ; but, while favouring the ascription
to Sophocles of the fragment from Plutarch, he nevertheless
printed it amongst the adespota. But there have not been
wanting critics to take another view. Tyrwhitt4 identified the
subject with the departure of Neoptolemus from Scyros in
obedience to the summons of Odysseus and Phoenix, who had
been despatched to Lycomedes in consequence of the disclosure
of Helenus that the co-operation of the son of Achilles was
essential to success. In recent years the opinion of Tyrwhitt
has been revived by Robert5 and Engelmann6, and I cannot
but think that fr. 557 is decisive in its favour. These words, if
spoken by Neoptolemus in conversation with Phoenix seem to
be exactly in place7; but they have no ascertainable relevance
to the story of Achilles and Deidamia. It would follow that
Sophocles and Euripides made use of the same title for legends
which, though parallel, were entirely distinct from each other;
and some might prefer to avoid this conclusion. Yet Euripides
did not hesitate to employ the title of Phrynichus' Phoenissae
for an entirely different purpose. Engelmann formerly8 identified

ὅπλα δίδωσι τὰ τοῦ πατρός· καὶ Ἀχιλλεύς αὐτῷ φαντάζεται
(EGF p. 36). This agrees with Hom. λ 308 f. Apollodorus
(epit. 5. 11) supplies the reason for the despatch of the envoys,
and states that Phoenix was sent with Odysseus. It is important
to note that the same account was adopted by Sophocles
in Phil. 344. We may perhaps infer from Philostratus (l.c.) that
Odysseus remained in the background, and that Phoenix intentionally
or by accident was the first to meet the boy.</p>
<p>In Quint. 7. 169 ff. Odysseus and Diomedes come to Scyros
to fetch Neoptolemus ; and the reason for the innovation appears
incidentally. They were the same envoys who had summoned
Achilles to take the fatal journey; and the coincidence increased
’s anxiety for her child, as she lay awake in the night
(242 ff.). No doubt in Sophocles also the parting of the boy
from his mother was the climax of the action: the archaeological
evidence alone, if its relevance were established, would be
conclusive. May we not also infer that Sophocles brought the
earlier mission within the purview of the characters, that
Odysseus felt it as a difficulty in his way, and that the hostility
of Lycomedes and Deidamia was aroused by their earlier experience?
That such was the case is at least probable. Although
it has sometimes been thought that the story of the bringing-up
of Achilles as a girl among the daughters of Lycomedes was of
late origin 1, it was the subject of a painting by Polygnotus
(Pausan. i. 22. 6) and must have been known to Sophocles as
well as to Euripides. The Iliad shows acquaintance with a version
according to which Achilles sacked Scyros (I 668), and doubtless
received Deidamia as part of the spoil. According to the Little
Iliad (fr. 4 K.) this was after the abortive landing in Mysia.</p>

<p>The sequence of thought is: ῾ the risks
run by seafaring folk in the hope of gain

can compensate them.᾿</p>
<p>1 τῶν ταλαιπώρων βροτῶν. For the
partitivegenitiveas predicate see Kuehner-
Gerth § 418. 1 (a), Madv. § 51c. But
the words are ill adapted to express the
thought that seafarers are the most
wretched people in the world, since οἱ
ταλαίπωροι βροτοί includes the whole
human race: cf. fr. 945, Aesch. Prom.
247, Eur. Supply 734, fr. 196. Still, we
can hardly regard as probable such conjectures
as φεῦ, ποντοναυτῶν ὡς ταλαίπωρον
πωpον γένος (Meineke), or τῶν ποντοναυτῶν
τοι ταλαίπωρον γένος (F. W. Schmidt).
Mekler (Philol. LIV 376), objecting to
the compound, proposed to reconstruct
as follows: &#x003C;aὐτὁσσυτον κίνδυνον ᾐρμένοι
πάλαι&#x003E; | ἥπτοντο ναῦται τῶν ταλαιπώρων
βυθῶν: but, as Wecklein remarked,
ταλαιπώρων is against this view. The
simplest solution would be to assume the
loss of a line after βροτῶν, containing the
idea: μάλιστ᾿ ἀεὶ τρίβουσιν ἄζηλον βίον.
Bernhardy unnecessarily suspected the
genuineness οf the whole fragment (Gr.
Litt. II3 2 p. 334).</p>
<p>2f. The MS reading must be corrupt,
and a contrast between δαίμων and τις
θεῶν does not seem likely here: see however
Tucker on Aesch. Theb. 510.
(i) Enger substituted τύχη χάριν for θεῶν
νέμων with πόνων for χάριν the following
line.· This view recognizes that ἀξίαν
requires a correlative, but fails to observe
that the risk to be recompensed is stated
in the following lines, which are in effect
a commentary upon ἀξίαν, and as such
are introduced without a connecting par-

<pb n="195"/>
tide (H. adds δ᾿ after λεπταῖς). Moreover
the antithesis of δαίμων and τύχη requires
justification: contrast e.g. Aesch. Ag.
667 ff. (2) F. W. Schmidt read οὔτε τις
θνητῶν πόνων πλείστων ποτ᾿, following in
part the same lines as Enger. But οὔτε
τις θνητῶν, thus baldly contrasted, is
a logical anticlimax after δαίμων: if no
god in the fullness of his power can give
compensation, how should we remark
applies to (3) J., who was inclined to
retain the text of the MSS with θνητῶν
for θεῶν. (4) For these reasons I have
accepted Meineke's  solution, except that
I have replaced θεῶν by θνητῶν rather
than by βροτῶν. Τhus we have ῾no divine
being nor man however rich᾿: γέμων
πλούτου is introduced, because κέρδος
(v. 6) is the motive inducing the sailor's
risk. Such are the Attalicis condicionibus
of Horace,which would never tempt the
merchant, were he not indocilis pauperiem
pati (Carm. 1. 1. 18). Cf. Antiph. fr.
101, 11 51 K. (Diogen. 4. 83, Men. mon.
664) ἐν γῇ πένεσθαι κρεῖττον ἢ πλουτοῦντα
πλεῖν. The securily which wealth gives
explains the metaphor of πολὺς πλούτου
λιμήν in Aesch. Pers. 253, Eur. Or.
1077.—δαίμων should probably be taken
strictly; for the δαίμονες were πλουτοδόται
(Hes. Op. 125).—For πλούτου Mekler
ingeniously suggested πλοῦ του.</p>
<p>4 ff. ῾For, whether success or failure
attend these poor wretches, they hazarded
distant ventures on all too slender a
chance.᾿ The emphasis is on the opening
words, which explain why the sailor
cannot earn ἀξία χάρις: he is always
taking too big a risk. Thus the main
stress of the sentence is thtown on the
participial clause, as so often happens in
Greek: Eur. Hel. 1214, Hclid. 111,
Phoen. 484. There is a good example
in Andoc. 2. 7 κατείποντι τὰ γεγενημένα
αὐτὸν. . .μὴ τεθνάναι (῾to be obliged to
reveal the truth in order to escape death᾿).
῾λεπταὶ ῥοπαί, turnings of the scale
which a small thing may decide. Cp.
Eur. Hipp. 1163 δέδορκε μέντοι φῶς ἐπὶ
σμικρᾶς ῥοπῆς (of a man hovering between
life and death)᾿ (J.). Following this
and similar phrases, Blaydes conj. λεπτῆς
ἐπὶ ῥοπῆς γάρ; but the dative is correct,
as e.g. in Xen. mem. 2. 1. 18 ἐπ᾿ ἀγαθῇ
ἐλπίδι. The thought that the seaman is
always close to death—protected by an
inch or two of timber—is one of those
that continually recur in Greek (and the
imitative Latin) literature: Hom. O 628

Meineke's ἐπὶ ῥιπῖσιν was a bad conjecture,
which was adopted by Nauck
and Dindorf, although the former ultimately
reverted to ἐπὶ ῥοπαῖσιν (Index,
p. XIII). It was suggested by the proverb
κἂν ἐπὶ ῥιπὸς πλέοις—the avaricious man
would go to sea ‘on a mat᾿ — for which
see Eur. fr. 397, Ar. Fac. 699 (Blaydes);
The word ῥιπίς meant ‘a fan,’ or ‘bellows,’
and had a short penultimate in the oblique
cases (Ar. Ach. 669, 888): Nauck quoted
Herodian π. διχρόνων, anecd. Ox. 111
p. 299, 10 τὸ μέντοι καρίς καὶ ῥιπίς ἡ μὲν
κοινὴ συνήθεια ἐκτείνει, ἡ δὲ τῶν Ἀθηναίων
διά λεκτος συστέλλει, but strangely thought
that ῥιπῖσιν was none the less admissible.
—The MSS justify the retention of the
locative form ῥοπῆσιν: see on fr. 659, 9.
—οἱ πολύφθοροι derives its force from
the idiomatic use of φθείρεσθαι to express
the wanderings of storm-tossed or shipwrecked
mariners: cf. Eur. Hel. 774
πόσον χρόνον | πόντου ’πὶ νώτοις ἄλιον
ἐφθείρου πλάνον, ib. 766 (n.), and see
Blomfield's glossary on Aesch. Pers. 457.
To translate, with L. and S., ‘braving
ruin and danger’ is entirely to mistake
the tone of the passage. The adj. is used
with the same intention in Aesch. Prom.

<p>It has been pointed out in the Introductory
Note that this fragment supports
Εngelmann's view of the plot, and that
the words are more suitable as addressed
by Neoptolemus to Phoenix than if
spoken by Diomedes as a consolation to
Lycomedes. There is perhaps some confirmation
of this contention in Quint. 7.
174, where the envoys on their arrival at
Scyros find Neoptolemus engaged in
practising the arts of war: καίπερ μέγα
τειρόμενον κῆρ | ἀμφὶ πατρὸς
τὸ γὰρ προπάροιθε πέπυστο.
Campbell also remarks that ‘the Fragments
indicate some representation of
the sorrow caused at Scyros by the news
of the death of Achilles.’</p>
<p>1f. The commonplace that tears are
of no avail to bring the dead back to
life appears first in Hom. Ω 550 οὐ γάρ

<p>5 was condemned by Herwerden,
with whom Nauck agrees. It is unnecessary
to the sense, and πρὸς τὸ
ἄγειν is carelessly repeated in v. 7 ; but
the verse should not on that account be
rashly rejected. For similar repetition,
see Jebb on O.C. 554, Phil. 1268, and n.
on Eur. Hel. 674. Blaydes thinks that,
if the line is kept, τοῦτ᾿ should be

ταῦτα looks forward as well as τοῦτο: see
e.g. Hdt. I. 125.</p>

alone; and γε is often found after γάρ,
but always with a word intervening: see
the examples quoted by Neil on Ar. Eq.

who refers to them that Blagdes's proposal
to read χάριν γε δακρύων πατήρ is
quite unnecessary. — δακρύων χὰριν, ‘if
tears would serve,’ is like O.C. 443

<p>ἀποστιβής is solitary, i.e. away from

find that all similar compounds follow
exactly the same pattern, and it would
be better if we ceased to speak of them
as ‘active’ or ‘passive.’ The
belonging to an apparently homogeneous
class may have sprung up at different
times, and may not all have been based on
the same analogy. Thus e. g. ἀπόπτολις
(O. Τ. 1000) seems to imply ἀπὸ
εἶναι ‘to be away from the city,’
in its ultimate analysis ἀπο- may
been an attribute rather than a preposition,
i.e. ‘having the city away.’ But, so
as the proportion ἀπόπτολις: ἄπολις or
the like was established, a number of other
words seems to have been formed on
this model, such as ἀπόθεος (fr. 267),
ἀπόξενος (O.T. 196), ἀπότιμος (ibid.
ἀπόμορφος (fr. 1022), ἀπόθεστος, ἀποχρήματος

ἀπόφονος (Wedd on Eur. Or. 163). On
the other hand, ἀπόσιτος, ἀπόδειπνος,

<p>Etym. M. p. 401, 37 shows that the
meaning of εὔωρος (‘careless’) was traced
by two paths, either from evojpelv in the
sense of ‘to be up early,’ ὅ ἐστι φυλάσσειν,
and so per contrarium (κατὰ ἀντίφρασιν)
‘negligent’; or from εὖ and ὤρα = φροντίς,
so that κατὰ ἀντίφρασιν εὔωρος becomes
ὁ μὴ φροντίζων. For ἀντίφρασις see on
fr. 116. The grammarians were not far
wrong when deriving from ὥρα ; for ‘ to
take a thing easily’ is to show
respect towards it: cf. εὐηθής. On
strength of the above evidence Person

Nauck, identified that play with the Σύνδειπνοι. A
reason was the title Ἀχαιῶν σύνδειπνον recorded by Athenaeus
(fr. 565), although there is no doubt that Σύνδειπνοι is correct:
cf. Athen. 365 B διόπερ τινὲς καὶ τὸ Σοφοκλέους δρᾶμα κατὰ τὸ
οὐδέτερον ἐπιγράφειν ἀξιοῦσιν Σύνδειπνον1. But the chief weight
of the case for identification rested on the assumption, now proved
to be erroneous, that the banquet of Tenedos was the occasion of
the principal incident included in the Ἀχαιῶν σύλλογος. On the
other hand, VVelcker, followed by Ahrens, Wagner, and Cope (on
Arist. rhet. 2. 24. 1401b 17), held that the plays were
He argued (pp. 232 — 240) that the subject of the Σύνδειπνοι was
the same as that of the later books of the Odyssey, in which the
disguised Odysseus contrived the overthrow of the suitors, so that
fr. 565 was brought into comparison with the conduct of Ctesippus
described in v. 299 ff. It is unnecessary to discuss Welcker's

<pb n="199"/>
theory, since the fragment first published by Fredrich (fr. 562),
in which Thetis addresses Achilles, upsets it once for all.</p>
<p>The nature of the plot is hardly doubtful. We learn from
Arist. rhet. 2. 24. 140Ib 17 ἢ εἴ τις φαίη τὸ ἐπὶ δεῖπνον κληθῆναι
τιμιώτατον· διὰ γὰρ τὸ μὴ κληθῆναι ὁ Ἀχιλλεὺς ἐμήνισε τοῖς
Ἀχαιοῖς ἐν Τενέδῳ· ὃ δ᾿ ὡς ἀτιμαζόμενος ἐμήνισεν, συνέβη δὲ
τοῦτο ἐπὶ τοὐ μὴ κληθῆναι, Philodem. περὶ ὀργῆς p. 66 (Vol.
Here. ΟΧ. 151) παραπεμφθέντες ὑπό τινος ἑστιῶντος ὥσπερ ὁ Σοφοκλέους
Ἀχιλλεὺς ἢ κατά τι τοιοῦτο παρολιγωρηθέντες, οὔπω γὰρ
ἀδικηθέντες λέγω, that in a play of Sophocles Achilles became incensed
with the Greeks at Tenedos, considering himself slighted
either by not receiving an invitation to a banquet or by the manner
of the invitation. The occasion is fixed by the allusion of Proclus,
from which it appears that Sophocles derived his material from
the Cypria (EGF p. 19): ἔπειτα καταπλέουσιν εἰς Τένεδον, καὶ
εὐωχουμένων αὐτῶν Φιλοκτήτης ὑφ᾿ ὕδρου πληγεὶς διὰ τὴν δυσοσμίαν
ἐν Λήμνῳ κατελείφθη· καὶ Ἀχιλλεὺς ὕστερος κληθεὶς
διαφέρεται πρὸς Ἀγαμέμνονα1. The stay at Tenedos occurred
immediately before the landing at Ilion, and Philoctetes was
bitten by the snake during the same banquet at which Achilles
showed his resentment at the lateness of his invitation. It is
obvious that the scraps preserved by Plutarch (fr. 566) belong
to the play mentioned by Aristotle and Philodemus; and the
title of the Σύνδειπνοι strongly suggests that this was the play
in question. The extant quotations assist the identification:
thus, the address to Odysseus in fr. 567 is a suitable pendant
to fr. 566, and the appearance of Thetis as dea ex machina
(fr. 562) is almost decisive in conjunction with the rest of the
evidence. The banquet at Tenedos must not be identified with
the occasion briefly described in Hom. θ 75—82, in spite of the
words ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ: for (i) the quarrel mentioned in the
Odyssey took place at a later period of the siege, and (2) the
altercation at Tenedos was between Achilles and Agamemnon,
not, as in the Odyssey, between Achilles and Odysseus. In reference
to the latter point, it is true that Odysseus bandied words
with Achilles in the play; but his motive was not to exalt his
own achievements. Achilles had threatened to return home,
and Odysseus cunningly prevented him from carrying out his
threat by suggesting that his real motive was cowardice, and
that the alleged slight was a mere pretence. It should be added
<note type="footnote">1 It has sometimes been supposed that the banquet, which was represented in this
play, is referred to in Cramer anecd. Par. III 55, 23 (schol. Hom. I 168) ὁ Φοῖνιξ παιδαγωγὸς

that Nauck assigns to this controversy Tr. fr. adesp. 35 ἤτοι
σατρατεύσεις ἢ μένων ἴσῃ κακός.</p>
<p>A question of some difficulty touching the character of the
play remains to be considered. How are we to account for
the unusual coarseness of fr. 565, and in what relation does it
stand to the corresponding passage of Aeschylus (fr. 180)?</p>
<p>(1) Naber (Mnem. XI 185) explained the similarity by
quoting Quintil. 10. 1. 66 tragoedias primus in lucem Aeschylus
protulit, sublimis et gravis et grandiloguus saepe usque ad vitium,
sed rudis in plerisque et incompositus: propter quod correctas
eius fabulas in certamen deferre posterioribus poetis Athenienses
permiserunt, suntque eo modo multi coronati, and concludes that
the Σύνδειπνοι was nothing more than a revised adaptation of
the Ὀστολόγοι. This view gained the approval of Nauck and
others (see n. on fr. 565), but appears to me altogether incredible;
and I am glad to find that it is unhesitatingly rejected both by
Wilamowitz and by Wecklein (Telephosmythus, p. 8)1. But it is
strange that those who propounded it did not observe that, since
the subject of the Ὀστολόγοι was the relations of Odysseus with
the suitors, it could not have been refurbished as a drama
depicting the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. Welcker
interpreted ὀστολόγοι as the beggars who gathered round the
table of the suitors, but Wecklein gives good reasons for referring
it to the collection of the bones after the burning of a corpse,
and identifies the ὀστολόγοι with the relatives of the murdered
suitors whose arrival to exact vengeance from Odysseus is related
in ω 412 ff. Both scholars agree, as against Hermann, Nauck
and others, that the Ὀστολόγοι was a tragedy and not a satyrplay;
and Wecklein argues forcibly that the character of fr. 180
is not inconsistent with tragedy, so long as the difference between
narrative and representation is borne in mind. The scene would
not have been represented on the stage, but might have been
described by a messenger in a tragic situation (cf Aesch. Cho.
751 ff.).</p>
<p>(2) For similar reasons it has been inferred that the Σύνδειπνοι
was a satyr-play: ‘satyricum fuisse drama ex fr. 140
[565] luculenter ’ (Nauck). But there can be no satyrplay
without a chorus of satyrs (see I p. 168); and, though the
satyrs might have been introduced as cooks (cf. fr. 563), just as
they appear elsewhere as hammerers (σφυροκόποι: p. 136)
acolytes (κήρυκες: TGF p. 36), it is difficult to imagine how
why they came to Tenedos, and the title Σύνδειπνοι rather points
to a chorus of chieftains. Welcker also argues that the lyrical
fragment (fr. 568) is too serious in tone for a satyr-chorus. On
<note type="footnote">1 See also Weil in Rev. des ét. gr. III 342.</note>

<pb n="201"/>
the other hand, it is contrary to the character of Sophoclean
tragedy to permit the introduction of a deliberate imitation of
Aeschylus, and the peculiarities of fr. 565 are in no wise parallel
to the casual repetitions referred to in the note on fr. 142, col. ii 24.
But the Σύνδειπνοι, even if technically τραγῳδία, was by no means
a tragedy in the modern sense of the word. Its leading motive
was trivial enough, and even in the few fragments that remain
it is possible to recognize here and there a bantering tone (see
frs. 563, 564). We are driven to the conclusion that the Σύνδειπνοι
belonged to that class of play of which the Alcestis of
Euripides is the only extant specimen, but that the comic
element was broader and more pronounced than in the work
of Euripides. In such a production it would not be surprising
to find a jovial reminiscence of the indignities suffered by
Odysseus in the very words which Aeschylus assigned to
Odysseus himself It may be that Sophocles occasionally
relaxed the severity of his genius by the composition of a
drama cast in a lighter and more cheerful vein, and by such
means displayed the bon viveur and darling of Athenian society
whom we know otherwise solely by repute: see vit. Soph, 5
(p. li BI.), Athen. 604 D. We must add Cic. ep. Quint. fr. 2.
16. 3 Συνδείπνους Σοφοκλέους, quamquam a te actam fabellam
video esse festive, nullo modo probavi1, although its import is not
entirely clear. As against the view of Tyrrell and Nauck that
an incident in the camp of Caesar is referred to, must be set
the fact that Quintus was at this time largely occupied in
writing or adapting tragedies, and used to send them on to
Marcus for his approval (l p. 173). We may render therefore: ‘I
don't care about the Σύνδειπνοι of Sophocles, although I perceive
that you have treated2 it wittily.’ So read the passage
the view of the play which has been reached on other grounds.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Ribbeck, Röm Trag. p. 620, takes a similar line, but reads factam for actam (after
Bücheler). The conclusion recommended may be thought inconsistent with the
advanced above (i p. 198), in relation to the composition of the Inachus. The
question is not so much whether a tragedy could be substituted for a satyr-play as the
fourth member of a tetralogy, for that is decided by the example of the Alcestis; as
whether a play characterized by an absence of serious motive could be produced as a
tragedy. The Σύνδειπνοι, in which a satyr-chorus appears to be unsuitable, is an
instance which suggests an answer in the affirmative. But the evidence is so fragmentary
and the countervailing considerations, to which attention has been directed,
are so weighty that we may well hesitate to pronounce judgement. The use of
τραγῳδία in Poll. 2. 224, where he may be referring to this play as well as to Aesch.
fr. 180, scarcely possesses the importance which has been assigned to it by some
critics. The Aeschylean Κάβειροι (TGF p. 31), which is inferentially described as
τραγῳδία in Athen. 428 F, seems to have been largely comic, as Wecklein (l.c. p. 1 1
points out.</note>

evidently thought that μετὰ σέ originally
formed part of the quotation from Soph.
(σ᾿ ὤρουσα. . .μέτα?), plausibly enough
far as concerns the text which he was
editing. But, when the two citations are
compared, it is evident that the scribe of
schol. Dion. Thr. left out a number of
words by letting his eye pass from one
ὤρουσα to the other. Whether this error
was connected, — and if so how — with the
mistake made in the order of the words
in the quotation itself are questions which
we cannot answer. The mysterious clause
ὅτι. . . Ἡσιόδῳ, for which cf. Phot, lex.
p. 260, 13, remains unexplained: Fredrich
regarded it as a marginal gloss incorporated
in the text. That a reference to
Hesiod has fallen out seems obvious, but
it is still possible that μετὰ σέ occurred in
Soph., — scarcely that it illustrated the
anastrophe.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to suppose that Thetis
arrived at the end of the play in order to
compose the feud. Wilamowitz remarked

not appear in the Cypria.</p>

<p>1 θυρᾶτε (see cr. n.) was first suggested
by Bergk, who however subsequently
abandoned it in favour of the
inferior κορεῖτε. Meineke appears
have made the same correction independently,
and it is almost certainly right.
φορεῖτε without an object expressed has
no meaning and cannot be used absolutely;
nor does the context here suggest
an object which might be supplied. On
the other hand φυρᾶτε is altogether apt.
The reference is to the preparation of a
μᾶξα, which, as distinguished from loaves
baked of wheaten meal (ἄρτον πέσσειν
ὀπτᾶν), was a lump of barley meal (ἄλφιτα)
kneaded together (μάσσω), then dried
a mould, and afterwards without further
cooking moistened with water, oil, or wine
— or combinations of such liquids — before
being eaten. The technical term for the
last-mentioned mixture, i.e. the result of
the final moistening, was φυστῆ or φύραμα,
and that is the process which φυρᾶτε here
describes. Cf. Thuc. 3. 49 ἤσθιόν τε
ἐλαύνοντες οἴνῳ καὶ ἐλαίῳ ἄλφιτα πεφυραμένα.
It is possible, as Hermann-Bluemner,
Privatalt. p. 218, observe, that this
illustrates Moeris p. 211,30 φυστῆ περισπωμένως
τὸ φύραμα τῶν ἀλφίτων, ὅταν μὴ
γένηται μῆζα, as being a case where
has been no preliminary kneading. It

<pb n="203"/>
will be observed that φυρᾶν and μάσσειν
are distinguished, in that the former expesses
the mixing with liquid, and the
latter the manipulation of the dough;
but, as the two actions may be concurrent,
both words, and especially μάσσειν,
are sometimes used less strictly. Cf. Xen.
Cyr. 6. 2. 28 καὶ γὰρ ὅστις ἀλφιτοσιτεῖ,
ὔδατι μεμαγμένην ἀεὶ τὴν μᾶζαν ἐσθίει.
Schol. Plat. rep. 372 B πέψαντες ἀρτοποιήσαντες,
μάξαντες δὲ φυράσαντες. Here
we may take it that the process is described
in its double aspect. — ἐγχείτω is
followed by κρατῆρα in place of the normal
ἐγχεῖν οἶνον εἰς κρατῆρα. Cf. Pind. Nem.
9. 50 ἐγκιρνάτω τίς μιν (scil. κρατῆρα), just
as we can readily speak in English of
‘mixing a bowl,’ or ‘pouring out
glass.’</p>
<p>2 f. ‘This man is like a plough-ox ;
he never works until he has eaten well.’
For πρὶν ἄν with the subjunctive in general
suppositions see Goodw. § 645. It has
been suggested that the person referred
to may be either Ajax, Diomedes, or
Achilles; and it is of course possible that
by ὅδ’ ἁνὴρ the speaker may intend to
describe himself (Ο. T. 534, etc.). —
καί: cf. Plat. Ion 531 D ἀλλ᾿ οὐΧ

The stall-fed ox became proverbial for refreshment
as a reward of labour: Philostr.

Agamemnon in Ηomer's words, βοῦς ἐπὶ

is different: the ox must be kept
fed, or he will not work. Porson's ὅδ᾿

Eum. 38 δείσασα γὰρ γραῦς οὐδέν, ἀντίπαις

ἀντίπαιδος is one who is little more than
a child. (2) Here, however, it means
‘grown up’ — no longer a child (so L. and
S.). Bekk. anecd. p. 407, 16 ἀντίπαις·

τοῦ παιδὸς ἡλικίαν. Lucian Am. 2 σχεδὸν

κριθείς. This shows that ἀντίπαις denoted
the age just below that of the ἔφηβος (i.e.
just below 18). Cf. Polyb. 27. 13. 4
where a person described as ἀντίπαιδα
κατὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν ὄντα — who is sent to
Rome for education — is. called μειράκιον
(J.). There is an instructive list of the
words appropriate to the ascending ages
preserved in Eustath. Od. p. 1788, 53 ff.
from the grammarian Alexion. Of the
age intermediate between παῖς and ἔφηβος
he says : τὴν δὲ ἑξῆς ἡλικίαν οἱ μὲν πάλληκα,
οἱ δὲ βούπαιδα (Ar. Fesp. 1206), οἱ
δὲ ἀντίπαιδα, οἱ δὲ μελλέφηβον καλοῦσιν.
The word is used several times by Plutarch
to describe one whom we should
call a youth. The most notable case is
when it is applied to Scipio Aemilianus,

taking part in the battle of Pydna at the
age of 17 (Aem. Paull. 22): see also
Philop. I, Dion 55, Cic. 7, Pomp. 76.
J. also suggested, as Tucker independently
conjectured, that ἀνδρόπαιδα (fr. 619)
should he read ; but this is unnecessary.

in an entirely different spirit. Cf.

Eum. 741, Tyrtae. fr. 11. Thus, by way
of honourable salutation or impressive
appeal, the father's name was always

<p>ὅδ᾿ ἐστιν ὅς ποτ’ ἀμφ᾿
γελωτοποιόν, τὴν κάκοσμον οὐράνην
ἔρριψεν οὐθ’ ἥμαρτε· περὶ δ’ ἐμῷ κάρᾳ
πληγεῖσ᾿ ἐναυάγησεν
χωρὶς μυρηρῶν τευχέων πνέουσ᾿
Καὶ Σοφοκλῆς δὲ ἐν Ἀχαιῶν συνδείπνῳ·
‘ἀλλ᾿...ὕπο.’ Eustathius Od. p.
30 also quotes the passage on the authority
of Athenaeus. For the allusion in
Pollux 2. 224 ἡ τραγῳδία τὴν ἀμίδα
οὐράνην ἐκάλεσε see p. 201.</p>
<p>The verses of Aeschylus are taken from
the Ὀστολόγοι, a satyr-play probably belonging
to the same tetralogy as the
Πηνελόπη. The speaker in Aeschylus
seems to have been Odysseus (Tzetzes on
Lycophr. 778) : and the offender — ὁ ῥίψας

<pb n="205"/>
— was one of the drunken suitors, perhaps
Ctesippus (Wecklein). In fr. 179 Eurymachus
is mentioned by name, and his
insults (doubtless to Odysseus) are described.
The plagiarism of Sophocles and
the reproduction from Aeschylus of a line
and a half verbatim are very remarkable;
and it would not be easy to find a parallel
in the existing remains of Greek tragedy.
Schweighauser, in a valuable note on
Athenaeus (vol. vi p. 143), quotes several
instances where whole lines are incorporated
bodily into his own work by a
later writer ; but the pertinent examples
are confined to comedy. Such are the
cases of Eubulus and Alexis (Athen.
25 F), of Antiphanes and Eriphas (84 BC),
and of Antiphanes and Epicrates (262 CD).
The imitation of Eur. fr. 385 by Agathon
and Theodectes (Athen. 454 Β—F) is not
analogous; still less that of Theognis by
Theophilus (Athen. 560 A). Thus it appears
that direct copying was practised
more commonly in comedy than in tragedy;
and possibly something of the same
licence attached to all plays of the less
severe type. At any rate the passage
certainly does prove that Sophocles
‘adapted’ the Ὀστολόγοι in this play, as
has sometimes been inferred (e.g. by
Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 67 13). See Introductory
Note (p. 201).</p>
<p>1 ἀμφὶ θυμῷ, in passion (prae ira).
So Eur. Or. 825 θανάτου ἀμφὶ φόβῳ Τυνδαρὶς
ἰάχησε, Aesch. Cho. 545 ἥ δ᾿ ἀμφὶ
τάρβει τῷδ᾿ ἐπῴμωξεν πάθει, Apoll. Rhod.
2. 96 ὁ δ᾿ ἀμφ᾿ ὀδύνῃ γνὺξ ἤριπε. περί is
somewhat more common : see e.g. Aesch.
Cho. 35. The construction plainly points
back to the adverbial origin of the
preposition.</p>
<p>2 κάρᾳ: for the form see Jebb on
O.C. 564.</p>
<p>3 οὐ μύρου πνέον. H, commenting
on Aesch. Ag. 131 1 οὐ Σύριον ἀγλάϊσμα
δώμασιν λέγεις, quotes Ar. Ran. 1150
Διόννσε, πίνεις οἶνον οὐκ ἀνθοσμίαν, Plut.
703 οὐ λιβανωτὸν γὰρ βδέω. For πνεῖν
μύρου see Blaydes on Ar. Pac. 525.</p>
<p>4 ἐδειματούμην, scared, is not without
a touch of hyperbole, but does not
merit the suspicion of Nauck and Herwerden,
the latter of whom wished to
substitute ἐλεηατούμην. Weil also conjectured
ἠδημονοῦμεν. We may assume
that the speaker, who, according to the
same critic, can have been none other
than Thersites, fled panic-stricken. For
the proceeding itself cf. Dem. 54. 4 τοὺς
παῖδας ἔτυπτον καὶ τὰς ἀμίδας
κατεσκεδάννυον.</p>

<p>Toup was the first who recognized that
this passage belongs to the Σύνδειπνοι:
the cause assigned to Αchilles᾿ anger
(which Wyttenbach did not understand)
is sufficient to fix the reference. Wecklein,
who adopts θυμαίνειν, finds here a
parody of the Μῆνις, and of the threat
of Achilles in I 356. See Introductory
Note. Η. renders thus:
OD. Already, at the sight of builded
Troy,
Art thou afraid?...
OD. I know
What thou dost shrink from, — not
from ill report.
But Hector is at hand, — no time
to stay!</p>
<p>1 εἰσορῶν. The scene of the play
was Tenedos, an island not more than

<pb n="206"/>
five miles distant from the west coast of
the Troad. — ἑδώλια, dwellings, as in El.
1393.</p>
<p>3 τὸ μὴ κλύειν follows the negative
verb φεύγεις. Cf. O.C. 1740 καὶ πάρος
ἀπέφυγε — τί; — τὰ σφῷν τὸ μὴ πίτνειν
κακῶς. See Goodw. § 811.</p>
<p>4 Nauck adopts θυμαίνειν, originally
recommended by Valckenaer on Phoen.
p. 312, but rejected by Brunck and Dindorf.
H. supports οὐ μένειν by quoting
Aristid. II p. 434 (a speech of Odysseus
to Achilles based on the ninth book of the
Iliad) τὶ δ’ ἔσται σοι τοῦ πλοῦ τὸ σχῆμα ;
...καλὸν δὲ τῇ Σκύρῳ νῦν προσχεῖν.
τί φήσεις πρὸς τὸν παῖδα τὸν σαυτοῦ; τί
τᾖ γυναικὶ δόξεις εἶναι βελτίων εἰπών; καὶ
τί λέγω Σκῦρον ἢ γυναῖκα; ἀλλὰ
φήσουσιν οἱ Τρῶες; ἆρ᾿ οὐ θεύγειν
φοβούμενον, ὁρῶντα οὐδεμίαν σωτηρίαν ἐὰν
μένῃς; Wyttenbach had already noticed
this point of agreement, but thought that
θυμαίνειν might equally well be defended
by p. 437 πάντως δὲ (sc. Ἕκτωρ λέγει)
οὐδὲ τὸν Δάρδανον τὸν ἑαυτοῦ πρόγονον
οὐδὲν εἶναι χείρω τοῦ Αἰακοῦ τοῦ σοῦ, σέ

(C.R. XVII 190).</p>

<p>For the story that Anticlea was with
child by Sisyphus before she came to
Laertes see Jebb on Phil. 417. Now
that G (see cr. n.) confirms Vater's conjecture,
we need not consider such suggestions
as Nauck's Σίσυφος πατήρ in v. Ι
and μητρὸς πόσις in v. 2 (modified by
Wecklein to πάντα Κοὐ), or Weil's κρυπτός
for μητρός. Besides, the allusion to Αuto
Hermes — Chione
lycus, ὃς ἀνθρώπους ἐκέκαστο
θ᾿ ὅρκῳ τε (Hom. τ 395), is too
lose. H. points out that Libanius (decl.
5. 61, V 339, 14 Foerst.) does not fail to
make Achilles use this taunt against
Odysseus: μέγα μέντἂν ὑπάρξειε
πονηροῖς εἰ τρυφῶντες ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις
ὁπόσον ἐθέλουσιν, εἶτ’ ἀποδόντες, ἐν τοῖς
ἐπιτηδείοις γεγράψονται. ἀλλ᾿ οὐδ’
τῷ πάττῳ τῷ σῷ τοῦτ᾿ ἂν ἤρκεσεν
εἰπεῖν, εἴπερ ἑάλω κλοπῆς, ‘ἀποδίδωμι·
κομίζεσθε τὰ φώρια.’ The genealogy is :
Ηermes—Chione
Autolycus — Amphithea
Aesimus Anticlea—Sisyphus (Laertes)
Sinon Odysseus</p>
<p>According to one form of the story,
as told by the scholiast on the Αjax,
Autolycus, having been outwitted by
Sisyphus in knavery, gave his daughter
to the latter in order to conciliate him.
The relationship to Sinon, another trickster,
is attested by Lycophr. 344. (See
p. 182.)</p>
<p>1 f. πάντα πράσσων bears the innuendo
of πανοῦργος, capable of every
(evil) deed. Cf. Apollod. fr. 13, 8 (III
291 K.) πράττουσι πάντα· τὴν γὰρ αἰσχύνην
πάλαι, | πᾶσαν ἀπολωλέκασι.
conjectures ὦ πᾶν σὺ πράσσων, which is
Anticlea — Sisyphus (Laertes)
unnecessary, but agrees with fr. 189 ὦ
πᾶν σὺ τολμήσασα. The phraseology
varies: cf. O.C. 761 ὦ πάντα τολμῶν, Ar.
Nub. 375, El. 615 χωρεῖν ἂν εἰς πᾶν
Tr. fr. adesp. 4 τοῦ πᾶν δρῶντος) (τοῦ
δικαίου. But πάντα ποιεῖν etc. are not
necessarily used in a bad sense : see on
Eur. Hclid. 841, and add Ο.Τ. 145, 265.</p>
<p>The combination of πολύς and πάντα
is awkward, but not necessarily illogical:
‘how much you resemble Sisyphus always'
or ‘in every case' (‘Thou
knave, how plain the Sisyphus | shows
thee always, and thy mother's father !’ H.).

<pb n="207"/>
Jebb has pointed out (on O.T. 475) that
the adverbial πάντα is very frequent in
Sophocles after verbs as well as adjectives:
Ant. 640 γνώμης πατρῴας πάντ᾿
ὄπισθεν ἑστάναι. The adverbial πούς is
like Eur. Bacch. 300 ὅταν γὰρ ὁ θεὸς ἐς τὸ
σῶμ᾿ ἔλθῃ πολύς, Or. 1200 τὸ πρῶτον
πολὺς παρῇ. H. was inclined to take ὁ
Σίσυφος as = ‘the character of Sisyphus’
τὸ Σισύφειον), referring to his discussion
of τὸν ἄνδρα in C. R. XV at p. 394; but
it is more likely that the article has its
ordinary force. — ἔνδηλος. Blaydes prefers
εὔδηλος, and the words are easily
confused; but there is nothing against
ἔνδηλος, which occurs in Ant. 405.</p>

<p>The sentiment, that oblivion covers
achievement in the absence of the record
of the Muses, is Pindaric: see Ol. 10.91

That lasting fame is the meed which
poetry alone confers is the burden of
Sappho's well-known fr. 68 κατθάνοισα
δὲ κείσεαι πότα, κωὐ μναμοσύνα σέθεν |
ἔσσετ᾿ οὔτε τότ᾿ οὔτ᾿ ὔστερον· οὐ
πεδέχεις βρόδων | τῶν ἐΚ Πιερίας.
it may be inferred that the reference is
not merely to the passing joy of music
at the banquet, as has sometimes been
supposed. Bergk (PLG III 101) indeed
conjectured that a fragment of Sappho,
λάθα Πιερίσι στυγερὰ καὶ ἀνάρσιος, had
coalesced with a passage of Sophocles
which ran: &#x003C;Λάθα δὲ μόνον Φάρμακον&#x003E;
ὀδύνας | μελέοις εὐποτμοτάτα θνατοῖς |
κτἑ.; and Campbell — independently,
it would seem — arrived at a
similar conclusion. But the necessity
for this is avoided, if we recognize that
the power of song invoked in the second
clause is contrasted with oblivion, and
that music is not introduced solely as
the healer of pain. H. suggested that
the argument was intended to awake the
ambition of the offended Achilles.</p>
<p>1 f. For the rhythm of these lines (an
Alcmanic quaternion followed by a paroemiac
[enhoplic] with catalexis) cf. Soph.

There is an almost identical combination
in Eur. Alc. 89 f. οὐ μὰν οὐδέ τις ἀμφιπόλων
| στατίζεται ἀμφὶ πύλας — Πιερίδων
it is impossible to justify the subordination
of the genitive to στυγερά and ἀνήρατος
by the analogy of such cases as Ο. C.
1519, 1722, and the simplest remedy
would be to accept the old correction
Πιερίαι. But the text of the whole fragment
is so doubtful, that it is perhaps
more likely that a word has fallen out
(ἀοιδαῖς for example) which would
supported the genitive. It is improbable
that Πιερίδων depended on Λάθα, although
some critics appear to have taken that
view. — κἀνήρατος. See cr. n. There
is no authority for ἀνάρετος, which L. and
S. translate ‘slothful.’ J. ’s emendation
is based on the occurrence of ἀνέραστος
and ἐπήρατος, and the analogy of ἀνήροτος,

<pb n="208"/>
ἀνήνυτος, and ἀνήκεστος: he refers to his
n. on Track. 247.</p>
<p>4 ἀνέχουσα κτἑ: ‘sustaining the
narrow pathway of life,’ as if it would
else be washed away by the pressure of
the neighbouring seas (ἁλιερκέα
δειράδα, Find. AM. i. 9). This remarkable
figure, which will not bear logical
analysis, has no exact parallel in Greek
literature, although the contrast of the
insignificance of life with the immensity
of eternity often appears. Perhaps the
best illustration is in Anth. Pal. 7. 472
μυρίος ἦν, ὤνθρωπε, χρόνος πρὸ τοῦ, ἄχρι
πρὸς ἠῶ | ἦλθες, χὡ λοιπὸς μυρίος
Ἀίδην. | τίς μοῖρα ζωῆς ὑπολείπεται,
ὅσον ὅσσον | στιγμὴ καὶ στιγμῆς
χαμηλότερον· | μικρή σεο ζωὴ
κτἑ. The comparison of time to a στιγμή
is attributed to Simonides (fr. 196). J.
recalls ‘From the great deep to the great
deep he goes,’ quoting O.C. 1226
κεῖθεν ὅθενπερδ ἥκει πολὺ δεύτερον ὡς τάχιστα
(n.). See also fr. 572. For the
metaphorical use of ἀνέχουσα cf. Pind.
Pyth. 2. 88 θεὸν...ὃς ἀνέχει τότε μὲν
κείνων, τότ᾿ αὖθ᾿ ἑτέροις | ἔδωκεν
κῦδος. — It might be thought that the reference
intended was to the shortness of
life's journey. This is Nauck's view,
who would substitute οἶμον for ἰσθμόν;
but it is less suitable to ἀνέχουσα.</p>

<p>The names Ἀζειοί and Ἀξειῆς are
mentioned on the quota-lists of the tributaries

Boeckh (Staatsh.2 II p. 665) restored
Ἀζιῶται in a single instance, where the
name occurs among the Ionian tributaries.
He accordingly inferred that a second
branch of the same tribe had settled on
the south coast of the Troad. They are
perhaps to be identified with the inhabitants
of Azus or Azes (gen. Ἄζου), who
constructed wooden images of Athene,
and worshipped them before a sea-voyage.
These images resembled the golden figureheads
of the goddess which were fixed on
the bows of ships. The Trojan Palladium
was originally brought from Azus to the
Phrygian king Tros. Such is the substance
of the information given by schol.

<lg>
<l>μάσθλης</l>
</lg>
<p>571 See on fr. 129. The only safe
inference is that Sophocles used the word
μάσθλης (or μάσθλη) in this play, in what
sense we cannot tell. Wecklein's ingenious
suggestion that μάσθλητας τομούς
is actually the quotation is attractive, but
far from certain. In that case we should
compare Homer's ἐϋτμήτοισιν
(K 567 etc.), El. 747 σὺν δ’ ἑλίσσεται
τμητοῖς ἱμᾶσιν, Eur. Hipp. 1245 χὡ μὲν
ἐκ δεσμῶν λυθεὶς | τμητῶν ἱμάντων.
same critic (Rh. Mus. XLI 469) held that
μάσθλης was the only genuine form, and
that μάσθλη was an error. He is followed
by Bruno Keil (Herm. XXII 645).</p>
<p>ΤΑΝΤΑΛΟΣ</p>
<p>To corroborate the doubtful testimony of fr. 572 in favour of
Sophocles having written a play entitled Tantalus, we now have
the explicit quotation in the Lexicon Messanense (fr. 573). There
is thus no more reason for entertaining a doubt in the case of
Sophocles than in relation to the similar citations from Phrynichus
(TGF p. 722), Aristias (ib. p. 726), and Aristarchus of
Tegea (ib. p. 728).</p>
<p>Tantalus, like Sisyphus, is better known for the punishments
said to have been inflicted upon him than for the transgression
which aroused the divine anger. Various acts of impiety are
recorded against him, each having the common characteristic
of wanton treachery in his dealings with the gods: the details
are conveniently summarized by Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 6564.
The accidental preservation of fr. 573, referring to the intervention
of Hermes, has probably revealed the version which
Sophocles dramatized. See schol. Pind. Ol. I. 91 οἱ μὲν γὰρ
αὐτόν (sc. Tantalus) φασιν ὑποκεῖσθαι Σιπύλῳ τῷ Λυδίας ὄρει,
αἰτίαν τινὰ προστιθέντες, ὡς Πανδάρεως ὁ Μιλήσιος ἀποκλέψας
τὸν κύνα τῆς Κρήτης, ὃν ὁ Ζεὺς φύλακα τοῦ ἱεροῦ
προτεθειμένος εἴη τῷ Ταντάλῳ. τὸν δὲ Δία ἀποστεῖλαι Ἑρμῆν

τὸν Δία ἐπιθεῖναι κατ᾿ αὐτοῦ Σίπυλον τὸ ὄρος, ὅπερ ἐστὶ τὸν
The errand of Hermes and his recovery of the golden dog are
also related in schol. Hom. τ 518, υ 66, Eustath. Od. p. 1875
32—35. It is curious that the particular punishment here recorded,
that Tantalus was buried under Mt Sipylus, should also
fit the language of fr. 572.</p>
<p>I have also brought under this title the papyrus fr. 574, which

<pb n="210"/>
is assigned to Sophocles by the preponderance of critical opinion,
but cannot be reconciled with the scheme of the Νiobe for reasons
given in the Introductory Note to that play (Ρ. 97). The speaker
is admitted to be Tantalus, and the scene Sipylus, to which Niobe

be unnatural for the punishment which Tantalus suffered vicariously
in the person ΟΙ his daughter to be described in the play
which chronicled his own downfall.</p>
<p>It should also be observed that the latter part of the papyrus
fragments is especially suitable to Tantalus, as is shown in the
notes. The destruction of his royal seat by an earthquake is
plainly referred to in fr. 575, 2 ff. Cf Arist. meteor. 2. 8. 368b 31

scientific writers record the tradition that a city on Mt Sipylus
fell into a chasm and was buried beneath a lake: Pausan. γ. 24.
13, Aristid. I 229 (Ρ. 372 D.). And Tantalus himself, as we have
seen, was fabled to have been buried beneath the mountain. Το

<p>574 These mutilated lines have been
deciphered from two pieces of papyrus,
which were published as No. CCXIII in
Oxyr. Pap. II p. 23, and denoted a and b
respectively. Each of these pieces contains
to the right of the principal fragment
very scanty traces of letters in the next
column; but nothing of these is legible
except κεραυ[νός] in b II. It is possible
that a II was placed above b i; and, if
so, the speech extended over three
columns, which were perhaps only of
moderate length. In any case it is certain
that a I (fr. 574) did not immediately
precede b i (fr. 575), although the size of
the interval which separated them cannot
be determined.</p>
<p>The handwriting, which is assigned to
the second century A.D., is of a rough
character, and the numerous blunders
and misspellings suggest that we have
to decipher the copy of a schoolboy. The
corruption in the parts of the lines which
are preserved is so great that the testoration
of the missing letters is rendered
unusually difficult, and the true readings
can hardly be recovered without radical
alterations. The tragic lines are written
on the verso of the papyrus, and the recto
is occupied with some accounts which are
dated in the first century A.D.</p>
<p>The first fragment appears to refer to
the fate of Niobe, and it follows that
Lydia was the scene of the play from
which it came. The speaker was probably
Tantalus, who in the other fragment
laments the loss of his kingdom, and
reflects upon the instability of fortune.
Blass inferred that the description of
Niobe turned to stone must have come
from the Niobe of Aeschylus or Sophocles,
and decided in favour of the latter,
partly because it is known that Sophocles
made Niobe return to Lydia at the
end of his play (p. 95), and partly on linguistic
grounds. The latter are as follows:
(1) In fr. 574, 2 ἐπεί is late in
the sentence: cf. Soph. Phil. 1343,
Trach. 11 74 ἐπειδή), Ο. T. 801 (ὅτε).
Nothing similar is found in Aeschylus,
but ἐπεί is not accepted here by Wecklein.
(2) Sophocles has several compounds in
which λίθος occurs, and Aeschylus has
none. (3) σθένει c. inf. occurs also in

certainly entitled to say that their sum
outweighs the fact that δίυγρος — which is
not certain — and σκηπτουχία are peculiar
to Aeschylus. He might have strengthened
his case by adducing the resemblance
of fr. 575, 9 f. to Soph. fr. 871. But these
conclusions have not been universally accepted.
Thus Robert (Herm. XXXVI 386)
admitted that the lines were Sophoclean,
but held that they did not belong to the
Niobe, for reasons which have already
been discussed (p. 97). On the other
hand, Wecklein (B. ph. W. 1900, p. 508)
strongly supported the claim of Aeschylus,
and was of opinion that both fragments
came from a messenger's speech. The
latter conclusion was also adopted by
Cronert (Arch. f. Papyrusf. I 511). For
the inference drawn in the present edition
see Introductory Note.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of the tragic vocabulary

alternative κὤμματος στάγας (coll. Apoll.

harsher than the nearest available parallels

κάλυβι is an otherwise unknown metaplasm:
cf. Δωδῶνι fr. 455. Similar
examples are the Homeric ὑσμῖνι, ἴκτινα
attributed to Aristophanes and others,
and the κίνδυνι of Alcaeus (fr. 138). See
Lobeck, Paralip. p. 169 ff.</p>
<p>8 ἀκαρδίοις, lifeless, is based on the
use of καρδία as vital principle which is

<p>9 θεωροῦντι is surely impossible, and
Wecklein's ὁρῶντι scarcely suits the data,
although the corruption is in any case
considerable. I take θαρσοῦντι to express
the earlier confidence of Tantalus in the
security of his good fortune: cf. Aesch.

given in our MSS, as in O.C. 491.

ἱστάναι μάχας θεοῖσι with μοιρῶν ἀντία is
not altogether satisfactory, and the statement
that men shrink from opposing the
gods is contradicted by the infatuation of
Niobe, who was not a solitary instance
of such daring. On the other hand, the
proximity of ἀντιαζον- to μοιρῶν is surely
not accidental, but must point to μοῖρα
λιταῖς ἄτρεπτος, an idea which is illustrated
by Headlam on Aesch. Ag. 70.

<pb n="214"/>
<p>ΤKΥΚΡOΣ</p>
<p>As this play is quoted by Aristophanes in the Ntibes, it must
have been produced before B.C. 423. Ahrens suggested that it
might have been prompted by the interest evoked by Cimon's
expedition to Cyprus in 450 B.C.; and from the allusion in the
Ajax presently to be quoted it might be argued that the Teucer
was earlier than that play.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the subject was the return of
Teucer to Salamis from Troy, his repudiation by his father
Telamon on account of the death of Ajax, and his departure
to Cyprus where he was commanded to found another Salamis
(Vellei, Pat. i. I). The anger of Telamon is anticipated by
Teucer in the Ajax (1007 — 1019); and Ribbeck assigns fr. 894
to the Teucer accordingly. It is generally believed that Sophocles
was closely followed by Pacuvius, whose Teucer was one of
the most famous Roman tragedies, and is several times quoted
by Cicero (Ribbeck, p. 224 ff.). There was a famous scene in
Pacuvius in which Telamon denounced Teucer for returning
without Ajax. From this Cicero quotes four lines in de orat.
2. 193, which also contain a reference to the loss of Eurysaces1.
It is a fair inference that these features were reproduced from
Sophocles. It is highly probable that Cicero also refers directly
to the play of Sophocles : Cic. Tusc. 3. 71 itaque Oileus ilk apud
Sophoclem, qui Telamonem nate de Aiacis morte consolatus esset,
is cum audivisset de suo fractus est. Then he quotes a Latin
version of the Greek original which is preserved by Stobaeus
(fr. 576) and by his MSS referred to the Oedipus2. Cicero's
introductory remarks shows that Οἰδίποδι is probably a corruption
of Ὀιλεῖ; but there is no play with the latter title,
nor was Oileus a likely hero οf tragedy. His name was therefore
preserved in the source of Stobaeus as the person referred to
in the extract, and not as having given his name to the work
from which it is quoted. It has also been suggested that he
was a character in the Ata? Λοκρός, but the circumstances of that
play (see I p. 8 ff.) make the supposition unlikely, especially as it
would follow that Telamon also appeared in it. Consequently
<note type="footnote">1 Segregare abs te ausu's sine illo Salaminem ingrediy | neque paternum
es veritus, quom aetate exacta indigem | liberum lacerasti lacerasti orbasti
fratris necis, | neque eius gnati parvi, qui tibi in tutelam est traditus ? — There
not seem to be any evidence throwing light on the fate of Eurysaces, other than that
which has been cited in the Introductory Note to the play so entitled (i p. 165).</note>
<note type="footnote">2 From the fact that Cicero quotes his own translation of Sophocles, Ribbeck
inferred that there was no corresponding passage in Pacuvius, but refused to go so
far as to deny that Oileus appeared at all in the Latin play.</note>

<pb n="215"/>
it seems that Oileus must have been represented in the Teitcer
as visiting Telamon and being at hand when the news of the
death of the greater Ajax arrived. It was natural that this
should precede the intelligence of the storm in which the
Locrian Ajax perished; the latter would be given by a survivor,
whose ship had escaped from the dispersal and destruction of the
fleets1.</p>
<p>Much more remarkable is the fact that Odysseus was one of
the characters; for his presence at Salamis after the storm involves
a departure from the scheme of the Odyssey, which we
should not have expected in Sophocles. Whether it was Odysseus
who described the storm (fr. 578) and brought to Oileus the
news of his son's death cannot be determined; but that he arrived
before Teucer, with whom he certainly engaged in altercation, is
made probable by the evidence of Aristotle, who alone mentions
him in this connexion: rhet. 3. 15. 1416b 1 κοινὸς δ᾿
τόπος τὸ σύμβολα λέγειν, οἷον ἐν τῷ Τεύκρῳ ὁ Ὀδυσσεὺς
οἰκεῖος τῷ Πριάμῳ· ἡ γὰρ Ἡσιόνη ἀδελφή· ὃ δὲ ὅτι ὁ
ἐχθρὸς τῷ Πριάμῳ, ὁ Τελαμών, καὶ ὅτι (αὐτὸς add. Roemer)
κατεῖπε τῶν κατασκόπων. The meaning is as follows : ‘Both
accuser and accused can use the topic of signs: thus in the
Teucer Odysseus argues that Teucer is friendly to the enemy
by reason of his connexion with Priam, whose sister Hesione
was his mother; to this Teucer rejoins that his loyalty should
be inferred, (i) from the fact that his father Telamon had been
Priam's enemy ; (2) because, if he had been a traitor, he would
have denounced the spies, which he did not.’ The second
appears to refer to the occasion when Odysseus entered
Troy in disguise, and was recognized by Helen (Hom. ὁ 242 ff.,
Eur. Hec. 239 ff., Rhes. 7 10). It is clear that Teucer was regarded
with suspicion by many of the Achaean chieftains (Ai. 102 1 ἐν
Τροίᾳ Γε μοι | πολλοὶ μὲν ἐχθροί, παῦρα ὁ ὠφελήσιμα) ; and,
Odysseus accused him of treachery, it should be remembered
that he anticipated a similar charge from Telamon (At. 10 13 ff.
τὸν ἐΚ δορὸς γεγῶτα πολεμίου νόθον, | τὸν δειλίᾳ προδόντα
κακανδρίᾳ | σέ, φίλτατ᾿ Αἴας, ἢ δόλοισιν). The
referred to in rhct. 2. 23. 1398a 4 ἄλλος ἐΚ τῶν εἰρημένων καθ᾿
αὑτοὺς πρὸς τὸν εἰπόντα· διαφέρει δὲ ὁ τρόπος, οἶον ἐν τῷ Τεύκρῳ·

ἂν τὰς ἐπὶ χρήμασιν· οὐ φάσκοντος δέ, εἶτα, εἶπεν, σὺ
Ἀριστοφῶν οὐΚ ἂν προδοίης, ἐγὼ ὁ έν Ἰφικράτης; Aristotle
introducing the topic according to which a speaker can make
an argument directed against himself recoil upon the accuser.
<note type="footnote">1 For the storm see fr. 578. It is mentioned more than once in the fragments of
Pacuvius.</note>

<pb n="216"/>
This, he says, is pecuHarly effective, as may be seen in the Teucer.
The reference intended was evidently famous, or else Aristotle
would have given the details ; but to us it is entirely obscure.
Cope suggests that the scene between Teucer and Odysseus is
again the subject of the allusion; and that Teucer, under accusation
of having caused his brother's death, thus rebuts the charge :
‘If you, Odysseus, are shocked at such a crime, do you suppose
that Ι, Teucer, could have been guilty of it?’ If it is
to guess at all, we may well believe that the force of the retort
lay in the suggestion that a charge of treachery came ill from
one who was the greatest master of cunning (δόλιος
Phil. 608 etc.). The defence of Teucer, when pleading agamst
conviction for having contributed to his brother's death, was so
notorious that he was said to have been the first man who
was obliged to state his case without leaving his ship, as in the
procedure of the court at Phreattys (Pausan. i. 28. 12).</p>
<p>Welcker p. 194 ff.) uses several of the fragments of Pacuvius
towards the reconstruction of the play, and has no hesitation in
assigning to it (after Blomfield) Tr. fr. adesp. 569 Τεῦκρος δὲ
τόξου χρώμενος φειδωλίᾳ | ὑπὲρ τάφρου πηδῶντας ἔστησεν
— verses which he thinks came from Τeucer's own lips. This
is hardly more probable than Ribbeck's conjecture1 that Soph,
fr. 894 refers to Telamon; but there is more reason for hesitation
in reference to Tr. fr. adesp. 318 τῷ γὰρ καλῶς πράσσοντι πᾶσα
γῆ πατρίς. The sentiment was proverbial, and occurs as a senarius
in more than one form (Ar. p. 1151, Macar. 6. 45); but
Cicero's evidence shows that the saying patria est ubicumque est
bene (Tusc. 5. 108) was commonly associated with the name of
Teucer. It is of course possible that he followed Pacuvius, and
that the source of Pacuvius was not Sophocles ; but this is not
very likely, in view of the celebrity which attached to the Sophoclean
version. In Teucer's case, the words bear an obvious
reference to his forced withdrawal to Cyprus ; and it is difficult
to see in what way the settlement at the Cyprian Salamis could
have been introduced into the end of the play, unless a god

through an oracle was given to him concerning the will of the

Δ
S has ΟΙ). ῾τοὺς δ᾿ . . .εἰρημένα.᾿ Cicero
gives a Latin version οf the passage
in Tusc. 3. 71 itaque Oileus ille apud
Sophoclem, qui Telamonem antea de
Aiacis morte consolatus esset, is cum
audivisset de suo fractus est. de cuius
comniutata mente sic dicitur:
nec vera tanta praeditus sapientia
quisquam est qui aliorum aerumnam
dictis adlevans
non idem, cum fortuna mutata impetum
convertat, clade subita frangatur sua,
ut illa ad alios dicta et praecepta
excidant.</p>
<p>Unless Hense is right in suggesting that
a quotation from either Oedipus is lost,
Cicero’s introductory words prove that the
reading Οἰδίποδι is an error, and that the
Δ
OI of S represents an original Ὀιλεῖ or
Ὀιλέως. This in its turn must have
descended from a fuller statement, such
as ἐς Ὀιλέα αἰνίττεται or περὶ Ὀιλέως
λέγει τοιάδε: see Introductory Note. It
is highly improbable that there was a
play entitled Oileus; and Welcker's hypothesis
that the lines belong to the
Teucer deserves acceptance in the present
state of the evidence. — For the general
sense of the passage Headlam (J. Ρ. XX
305) quoted Aesch. Prom. 279, 351 and
Tr. fr. adesp. 342 ἐλαφρὸν παραινεῖν

occurs in Eur. Andr. 240, and in
all probability in Phil. 572.</p>
<p>3 The infinitive συμπαραινέσαι cannot
be explained as the text stands in the
Mss; and it is generally assumed that
καλῶς, for which Headlam (J.P. XX 305),
Blaydes, and Nauck (Index, p. XIII) have
independently suggested δεινούς, Cobet
gave καλούς, and Stadtmueller ἱκανούς,
is corrupt. H. quotes Aristid. II 491
δεινοί τινες εἰσὶ νουθετεῖν ἑτέρους, ἀφέντες

Hipp. 921 explains δεινὸν σοφιστὴν εἶπας
by ἀληθῶς καλὸν διδάσκαλον εἶπας, and
that in Eunap. p. 58 οὐδὲν ὑποστὰς δεινόν
there is a v.l. κακόν. Similarly he wished
to restore δεινόν γ᾿ ἔρωτα for μέγαν γ᾿

ἔρωτα in Eur. Med. 689, on the strength
of Eur. fr. 850, ib. 1054, Hermesianax
(Athen. 599 b) 96. But, as Hense remarks,
καλῶς is confirmed by v. 6. I
cannot however agree with the last-named
critic that the inf. depends on οἷος; for
that idiom would require οἵους to balance
the antecedent. The simple correction
συμπαραινέσας makes everything coherent,
and gives its due weight to νῦν,
which is otherwise pointless: ‘ the wisest
men are no better than Oileus in his
present mind, although he once gave good
advice to a sufferer.’ The three
lines thus stand in their proper relation, as
explicatory of the opening sentence: the
function of δέ (v. 4) in such a connexion
( = γάρ) is familiar (Eur. Hel. 544 n.).</p>

he raises the balance,” etc.
(used by Eur.) would be more strictly
appropriate to the metaphor — “inclining
in the opposite direction.” But
is also correct, marking the reversal
of fortune.’ (J.) In my opinion, Cicero's
paraphrase is too loose to be of any use
in determining the reading of his original,
and I do not think it likely that he read
μάστιγ᾿. However, πλάστιγγ᾿
preferable (cf. Anon, ap Stob. ecl. r. ὁ. 13

δοθὲν μακαριστότατον τελέθει, in an address
to Fortune, Trag. fr. adesp. 179 ἀνώμαλοι
πλάστιγγες ἀστάτου τύχης), and the confusion
of the two words here supports the
contention of those who would restore
μάστιγι in Aesch. Cho. 289. ἐρείσῃ is
entirely appropriate, as its usage shows,
and Blaydes (on Ar. Ran. 1378, Pac.
1248) should not have proposed πλάστιγγα
ῥέψῃ or κρούσῃ: the figure of
δαίμων ἐρείδων need not be so crudely
conceived as to recall the δύο κῆρε of
Hom. X 210. On the other hand,
Meineke's παλίρροπον is a great improvement
(Lucian Amor. 4 καθάπερ ἀκριβὴς
τρυτάνη ταῖς ἐπ᾿ ἀμφότερα
ἰσορρόπως ταλαντεύομαι), and should be
adopted; it would be difficult to find a
parallel for παλίντροπον as here employed.

<p>This schol. is not in R. Nauck (Index,
p. Xlll) said ‘ἐρράγη δι᾿ αἰθέρος’
and Blaydes approved. But δι᾿ ἀστραπῆς,
though difficult, is not manifestly corrupt.
Thus it might be said either (i) that the
thunder finds an outlet by means of the
lightning, or (2) that ἀστραπή is conceived
as locally extended, as if we could say
’the thunder burst across the flash.’
The latter alternative is to be preferred,
especially if we take into account the imperfect
knowledge of the time. Popular
notions of science would then be derived
from the speculations of the Ionian physicists;
sicists; and Anaximander (Diels, Vorsokr.3
p. 20, 2) and Anaximenes (ibid.
p. 25, 11) agreed in deducing thunder and
lightning from the operation of πνεῦμα:
ὅταν γὰρ περιληφθὲν (sc.d τὸ πνεῦμα) νέφει
παχεῖ βιασάμενον ἐκπέσῃ τῇ λεπτομερείᾳ
καὶ κουφότητι, τόθ᾿ ἡ μὲν ῥῆξις τὸν ψόφον,
ἡ δὲ διαστολὴ παρὰ τὴν μελανίαν τοῦ
νέφους τὸν διαυγασμὸν ἀποτελεῖ. If we
think of βροντή and ἀστραπή alike as
πνεύματα, i.e. λεπτομερῆ σώματα, the
language of Sophocles is more easily intelligible.
(3) Starkie's ‘thunder mixed
with lightning’ seems to imply a succession
in space or time. This is possible, but
seems somewhat forced, if compared with
the examples given in Kuehner-Gerth
I 482.</p>

<p>Cychreus (or Cenchreus: Diod. 4. 72),
son of Poseidon and Salamis, was an
ancient hero-king of Salamis. When
Telamon came there as an exile after
the death of Phocus, he was welcomed
by Cychreus, and ultimately succeeded
him on the throne (Apollod. 3. 161).
Legend also connected him with a
dragon. Either he was the dragon
himself, and actually appeared to the
Athenians in this form at the battle of
Salamis (Pausan. i. 36. I); or was called
Ophis by reason of his cruelty, —a later
variation (Arr. Nic. fr. 72 = FNG III
599); or kept it as his familiar (Hesiod
fr. 107 Rz.); or slew it with his own
hand, and delivered the island from its

<pb n="220"/>
depredations (Apollod.l.c., Diod. 4. 72).
The island was sometimes called Cychreia
after him (Strabo 393 : cf. Aesch. Pers.
573 ἀκτὰς ἀμφὶ Κυχρείας). He had a
sanctuary at Salamis, and was worshipped
there as well as at Athens and Eleusis
(Plat. Thes. 10, Sol. 9). It is possible
that there is an echo of Sophocles in
Lycophr. 451, where he mentions the
cave of Cychreus in connexion with the
banishment of Teucer: ὁ μὲν πατρὸς
μομφαῖσιν ἠλαστρημένος | Κυχρεῖος ἄντρων
Βωκάρου τε ναμάτων.</p>
<p>ΤΗΛΕΦΟΣ</p>
<p>Kaibel in Herm. XXIII 268 ff. published from the notes of
Ph. Bonarotti a Rhodian inscription dated about 100 B.C. in
which the Telephus of Sophocles is apparently mentioned as a
satyr-play1. If his reading is correct, Welcker’s identification of
the Telephus with the Mysians cannot be accepted. The subject
is entirely unknown ; but the mountains ΟΙ Arcadia were the
best of all scenes. for a chorus of satyrs, and the circumstances
of Telephus’ birth and his subsequent discovery by Heracles
provided a suitable setting. As an illustration of the uncertainty
of all such speculations, it may be mentioned that Wecklein
(Telephosmythns, p. 22) finds the material οf the Telephus in
the same passage of Moses Chorenensis {progymn. 3. 3) which
Wilamowitz selected as the basis for his reconstruction of
Euripides’ Auge. The extract is quoted in full by Nauck, TGF
p. 436.</p>
<p>Vater (Aleaden, p. 31) conjectured, though for unsatisfactory
reasons, that the Telephus was a satyr-play, but there is no probability
in his view that the subject was the wounding ΟΙ Telephus
and his subsequent healing by Achilles. The same suggestion
was made independently by Thraemer (Pergamos, Ρ. 379), and
by Pilling (Teleph. fab. p. 24). These critics could not anticipate
that the healing of Telephus would prove to have been a leading
feature in the Ἀχαιῶν σύλλογος (l p. 95).</p>

perhaps add Etym. M. p. 21, 45 ἀείφροθρος·

If ἀειφόρος was the word used by Sophocles,
it becomes necessary to restore it on 
p. 89 for αἴφροθρος, as Alberti proposed.
Then the second ἀειθαλής on p. 53 must
be deleted (with M. Schmidt); and we

<pb n="221"/>
may hold that the lemma ἀείφρουρος refers
to Ant. 892. But, if that is the right
solution, it is a very strange coincidence
that ἀειθαλής should have been foisted in
as a gloss to ἀείφρουρος on p. 53, while
ἀειφόρος on p. 89, properly glossed by
ἀειθαλής, was corrupted to αἴφρουρος. It
is more probable that the solution proposed
by Porson (ap. Dobree on Ar. Nub.
518) is correct, viz. that the two glosses
on p. 53 should be run together as
ἀείφρουρος· ἀεὶ διαμένων, ἀειθαλής Σοφοκλῆς
Τηλέφῳ. Cobet was of the same
opinion: see N. L. p. 343, Coll Crit.
p. 192. Then ἀειφόρος, which does not
occur elsewhere, is merely a diplomatic
blunder for ἀείφρουρος. We must assume
that in ἀείφρουρος, as often happens (Eur.
Phoen. 2 n.), the second member of the
compound would tend to lose its distinctive
force; and the gloss ἀειθαλής is
confirmed by Cratin. fr. 98 (i 43 K.) τῷ

<p>ΤΗΡΕΥΣ</p>
<p>Although Thucydides implies (2. 29) that the legend of
Tereus was familiar to poetry, no detailed account is in existence
which can be traced to an earlier date than the era of Sophocles.
In Horn. Τ 518 ff. the nightingale is the daughter of Pandareos,
lamenting her son Itylus, whom she had slain δι᾿ ἀφραδίας.
father of the boy is said to be Zethus. The scholia explain the
lines by narratives which have no connexion with the Attic story,
as it has become known to us from later sources. In Hes. Op.
568 and Sappho fr. 88 the swallow is called daughter of
Pandion, and Aelian (var. hist. 12. 20) certainly suggests that
Hesiod elsewhere (fr. 125 Rz.) referred to the vigil of the nightingale
as the consequence of the impious banquet. But the first
explicit reference in literature which corresponds in detail with
the later story is in Aesch. Suppl. 60 ff., where the nightingale is
identified with the wife of Tereus bewailing her son slain by her
own hand. Thenceforward the lament of the nightingale for
Itys became a commonplace: Ag. 1442, Soph. El. 107, 148
Eur. fr. 773, 23, Rhes. 545 etc.</p>
<p>There is remarkably little variation in the complete accounts
of the story which have been preserved by the mythographers,
so that it is possible to present a narrative drawn from the
consensus of the chief authorities.</p>
<p>Tereus the Thracian was wedded to Procne daughter of
Pandion1, who after a time desired to receive a visit from her
sister Philomela, and requested her husband to go to Athens to
fetch her. Tereus, however, became enamoured of Philomela,
and abused his opportunity by violating her; but, fearing lest the
rumour of his crime should reach the ears of Procne, before
leaving her he cut out ’s tongue. Philomela then wove
an embroidered picture of the outrage which had been inflicted
<note type="footnote">1 In some authorities the betrothal of Procne is spoken of as a favour bestowed
upon Tereus for assistance rendered against Labdacus (Apollod. 3. 193: cf. Ov. Met.
6. 424).</note>

<pb n="222"/>
upon her, and contrived that it should be conveyed to Procne.
When Procne learnt the truth — for Tereus had made excuse that
Philomela was dead — she sought out her sister, and, in concert
with her and in order to be revenged upon her husband, killed
her son Itys, cooked his flesh, and served it as a meal to Tereus.
When he had feasted, the sisters discovered the truth to him
and took to flight. Tereus, spurning the table from him, and
seizing his sword, rushed after them. Then the gods in pity
changed Procne into a nightingale and Philomela into a
swallow; and Tereus became a hoopoe.</p>
<p>The above features, subject to certain unimportant reservations,
are common to Ov. Met. 6. 433—674, Apollod. 3. 193—195,
schol. Ar. Av. 212, Conon 31, Liban. narr. 12 p. 1 103, Achill.
Tat. 5. 5, Eustath. Od. p. 1875, Nonn. 4. 321, 12. 75; and they
are brought into connexion with Sophocles by Tzetzes on Hes. Op.
566, who, after briefly stating the chief points in the story,
concludes with the words γράφει δὲ περὶ τούτου Σοφοκλῆς ἐν τῷ
Τηρεῖ δράματι. It is well known that certain Latin writers1,
including Ovid, owing perhaps to a mistaken etymology, made
Philomela the nightingale instead of Procne, and that some
of them also represented her as the wife of Tereus (Conington
on Verg. Ecl. 6. 78). The latter change was a necessary consequence
of the former, since it was unnatural to convert the
tongueless Philomela into a nightingale. Eustathius makes the
confusion even worse by adopting the latter change without the
former.</p>
<p>Hyginus (fab. 45) alone is responsible for a version differing
in certain essential features. In this Tereus pretends that
Procne is dead and asks for Philomela to take her place. When
his request is granted, an escort is sent with Philomela, but
Tereus throws them into the sea. After he had worked his will
on Philomela, he entrusted her to Lynceus a Thracian king,
whose wife Laethusa, being friendly to Procne, handed over to
her the supposed mistress of Tereus. Meanwhile, Tereus had
been warned by divination that his son Itys was threatened
with danger from a relative. Suspecting that his brother Dryas
was plotting against his son, Tereus slew Dryas. The story
ends in the usual manner ; but Procne, in accordance with the
Latin variation already mentioned, becomes the swallow, and —
what is much more remarkable, as we shall presently see — Tereus
is changed into a hawk (accipiter). Since this version certainly
does not proceed from Sophocles, we need not delay over it.
There was no justification for ’s proposal to incorporate
the episode of Dryas, which occurs nowhere else, in his recon-

<pb n="223"/>
struction of the present play. ’lhheck. (Rom. Trag. p. 35 ff.)
conjectured that the version of Hyginus was adopted by Livius
Andronicus; it would be more interesting to discover who first
propounded it.</p>
<p>We have more information about the Tereus than about
most of the lost plays of Sophocles. It was probably produced
shortly before the Aves of Aristophanes (414 B.C.)1, in which the
Hoopoe — formerly Tereus — is aleadingcharacter. His appearance
excited surprise (99): τὸ ῥάμφος ἡμῖν σου γέλοιον φαίνεται. But
he replies that it is all the fault of Sophocles: τοιαῦτα μέντοι
Σοφοκλέης λυμαίνεται | ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαισιν ἐμὲ τὸν
schol. explains: ἐν γὰρ τῷ Τηρεῖ Σοφοκλῆς ἐποίησεν αὐτὸν
ἀπωρνιθωμένον καὶ τὴν Πρόκνην· ἐν ᾧ ἔσΚωψε πολλὰ τὸν Τηρέα.
Lest any one should be troubled by the concluding clause, it is
perhaps worth while to remark that it is only an unintelligent
comment on λυμαίνεται. Some of the commentators suppose
that the dress of Epops in the Aves was a caricature of Tereus
as he appeared on the tragic stage after his metamorphosis. But
Rogers justly remarks that Sophocles ’was far too great an
artist to have exhibited the transformation on the stage (ne
coram populo. . . in avem Procne vertatur, Horace, Α. Ρ. 185—7) or
to have introduced Tereus afterwards in the guise of a hoopoe.’
Later in the comedy (280) another ἔποψ appears, and is
described: οὑτοσὶ μέν ἐστι Φιλοκλέους | ἐξ ἔποπος, ἐγὼ δὲ
πάππος. On this the scholiast remarks that Philocles had written
a Tereus in the tetralogy Πανδιονίς. The innuendo is that
Philocles had plagiarized Sophocles, whose play was the earlier:
ὁ Σοφοκλῆς πρῶτον τὸν Τηρέα ἐποίησεν εἶτα Φιλοκλῆς. Even
Nauck treats this statement as if πρῶτον was πρῶτος2. However,
there is no trace of Aeschylus or Euripides having composed
on the subject; and consequently Welcker argued that the
important fragment (fr. 304 N.2) quoted from Aeschylus by
Aristotle really belonged to Sophocles. Though Tereus is not
mentioned, it would not be easy to find any context to which
this fragment would be so well adapted as to a description by a
messenger of his transformation 3. Welcker's position has
strengthened by Oder4, who pointed out that the earlier form of
<note type="footnote">1 But Hiller v. Gaertringen (p. 36) makes it earlier than 421, on the ground that
Eumolpus in the Euripides of Euripides was copied from ’ Tereus. Observe
that, if Eur. Her. 102 1 f. implies that the Tereus was already in existence, the date
would be not later than 420; for the Heracles probably belongs to the years 420—416.</note>

<pb n="224"/>
the legend transformed Tereus into a hawk, that this was
followed by Aeschylus in the Supplices (κιρκηλάτου τ᾿ ἀηδόνος,
63), and that Sophocles' substitution of the hoopoe rests on unimpeachable
evidence. It is obvious that the fable of the change
of colour and shape in the hoopoe is especially well adapted to
explain and justify the novelty introduced into the story of
Tereus, for whatever reason the hoopoe came to be associated
with him. The simplest view to take is that the existence of
the popular superstition identifying the two birds was the cause
of the alteration in the legend. If the hoopoe was a rare and
unfamiliar bird in the fifth century B.C., as Oder argues, there is
the less reason to feel surprise at its substitution for the hawk.
For, in spite of its appearance, the hoopoe is actually a shy and
timid bird, which is scared even by the flight of a passing
swallow. Oder also showed that the periphrastic ἀποδηλώσας
ἔχει and the use of ἡνίκα were characteristic of Sophocles, and
that both are unfamiliar to Aeschylus. Although one is loth
to conclude that Aristotle's1 memory was at fault, he has been
guilty of a similar error, as Welcker remarks, in attributing
Eur. fr. 515, I to Sophocles. On the whole, although the
scholiast on Aristophanes is not decisive of the chronology,
’s case is so strong that I have included the fragment
in the remains of this play (fr. 581).</p>
<p>The other references to the play of Sophocles are unimportant:
Liban. decl. IV p. 369 f. καλῶς ἄρα οἱ τραγῳδοὶ ταῦτα
ἐδίδασκον, τὸν Τηρέα, τὴν Πρόκνην. Ov. Trist. 2. 389 facit amor
subitas volucres cum paelice regein, | quaeque suum luget nunc
quoque mater Itym, following v. 381 omne genus scripti gravitate
tragoedia uincit. The title was also employed by the comic
poets Cantharus, Alexandrides, and Philetaerus; and at Rome
the subject was adapted by Livius Andronicus and Accius.</p>
<p>The next question is where Sophocles laid the scene of the
play. From frs. 582 and 587 it would be natural to conclude that
the action took place in Thrace, in agreement with the statements
of the majority of the ancient authorities. Thucydides, however,
energetically protested (2. 29) : ὁ μ·ὲν ἐν Δαυλίᾳ τῆς Φωκίδος νῶν
καλουμένης 7779 ὁ Τηρεὺς ᾤκει, τότε ὑπὸ Θρᾳκῶν οἰκουμένης, καὶ
τὸ ἔργον τὸ περὶ τὸν Ἴτυν αἱ γυναῖκεσ ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ ἔπραξαν.
He was followed by Strabo (423), Pausanias Ι 41. 8, 10.
4. 9), and Conon (31). Welcker and Ribbeck assume that
Sophocles agreed with Thucydides; whereas Μ. Mayer2, holding
<note type="footnote">1 Dittmeyer holds that the 9th book of the hist. an. is spurious, having been compiled
from Theophrastus and other sources at the beginning of the third century. See
also Gercke in Pauly-Wissowa ΙΙ 1047.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 Herm. XXVII 491. See also Gruppe, p. 927.</note>

<pb n="225"/>
that the protest of Thucydides was directed against the present
play, conjectures that Sophocles deliberately altered the locality
from Daulis to Thrace. Certainly there is no evidence that
Sophocles used ‘Thracian’ in any other than its ordinary sense,
and it seems likely that, so far as the poetic tradition was concerned,
Thucydides was the innovator rather than Sophocles.
That is not to say that he did not know of a local tradition
connecting Tereus with Daulis; and the historical question as to
the presence of Thracians in southern Greece is another matter
altogether1.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it is important to remember that the gruesome
history was enacted among a rude and savage people (cf fr. 587) ;
and the terrible revenge exacted by the Athenian women shows
the effect upon their character of alien surroundings and
barbarous treatment (cf frs. 583, 584). For Tereus in the
character of a fierce barbarian see on fr. 581, 3. In this connexion
Welcker makes much of the festival on the mountains of the
Dionysian trieteiHca, which Ovid alone2 of the authorities records
(587 ff.), telling how Procne disguised herself as a bacchant to
seek out her ’s hiding-place in the wilds. But there is
reason to suppose that the discovery was not effected in exactly
the same way by Sophocles. Fr. 595 is of supreme importance
as attesting the use made of the embroidered robe; but it also
appears that Philomela employed an intermediary who was
acquainted with the details of her story (fr. 588), whereas in
Ovid the whole truth is gathered by Procne from the robe. Unless
it was covertly smuggled into the palace, some pretext must
have been devised to warrant its presentation to Procne.
Libanius shows appreciation of this point, by stating that it was
sent on the occasion of a festival when it was customary for the
Thracian women to make presents to the queen. This may
perhaps go back to Sophocles. The other fragments are not of
much importance for the elucidation of the plot. Fr. 583 is
clearly a lament of Procne for her estrangement from home ties,
and suggests that her desire for the presence of Philomela was
the original cause in Sophocles, as in Ovid, of all the subsequent
troubles. Fr. 584 was probably addressed by Procne to the
chorus: Welcker's idea that it followed an invocation of the
absent Philomela is less likely. Fr. 585 is the consolation
offered to Procne by the chorus, or by Philomela's messenger,
after she has learnt of the outrage. For fr. 586 see note in loc.
<note type="footnote">1 See Kretschmer, Einl. in d. Gesch. d. gr. Sprache, p. 242.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 Welcker and Ribbeck find it also in Accius. Hiller v. Gaertringen refers to the
festival of the Ἀγριώνια, when the priest of Dionysus pursued a woman with a drawn
sword (Plut. qu. Gr. 38 p. 299 F).</note>

<pb n="226"/>
Fr. 582 is, according to Welcker and Ribbeck, the cry of Tereus
after his discovery of the women’s revenge. Frs. 581 and 589
belong to the announcement of the final destiny of the chief
characters, whether this was made by a messenger or by a god.
Fr. 590 probably comprised the concluding words of the drama.</p>

upupa, ut tradit Aeschylus poeta. Pliny
is hardly an independent witness. For
the reasons which seem to prove that
Aristotle was mistaken in referring these
lines to Aeschylus rather than to Sophocles
see Introductory Note.</p>
<p>1 τοῦτον δ᾿ shows that a reference to
the metamorphosis of Procne and Philomela
went before.—ἔποψ (Cf. upupa, Varro 
ling. Lat. 5. 76) is explained as ἐπόπτης
spectator, Oder (l.c. p. 553) points out
that in consequence of this derivation it
became associated with the name Tereus
(τηρεῖν). Cf. schol. Ar. Αν. 102 ὁ λεγόμενος
Τηρεὺς παρὰ τὸ τηρεῖν τὴν Ἰώ.
Etym. M. P. 757, 45 Τηρεύς, ὁ τηρῶν τὰ 
ἡδονὴν ἀγεῖραι δυνάμενα, καὶ ἀκρασίᾳ ἡδονῶν
λελημμένος.</p>
<p>2 κἀποδηλώσας ἔχει: for the Sophoclean 
periphrasis see on fr. 489.</p>
<p>3 Θρασύν is a popular error, as applied
to the ἔποψ: see Introductory Note. But
πετραίον, ῾living amongst the rocks,᾿ and
so ’solitary,’ is consistent with the bird’s
habits. For the word cf. Eur. El. 805,
and see Jebb on . O. T. 476.—ἐν παντευχίᾳ
describes the rather formidable
appearance of the bird. It has a long,
pointed bill, variegated plumage and a
large erectile crest (Encycl. Brit. s.v.).
But there is a more particular reference to
Tereus, who was represented on the stage
as a warlike savage: cf. Ar. Lys. lb 563
ἕσπερ ὁ αὖ Θρᾷξ πέλτην σείων κἀκόντιον
ὥσπερ ὁ Τηρεύς,—where we should probably
recognize an allusion to Sophocles.

Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὔτ᾿ ἄν Θρᾳξὶν ἐν πέλταις
καὶ ἀκοντίοις...ἐθέλοιεν ἄν διαγωνίζεσθαι.
In Apollod. 3. 195 Tereus pursues the
women with an axe. But this touch may
be connected with the Asiatic version in
schol. Hom. τ 518.</p>
<p>4 διαπαλεῖ: to ply the wing, like
νωμᾶν πτερόν (fr. 941, 11 n.). The pre-

position probably expresses the separate
movement of the two pinions.</p>

forms coming from a single birth, the
fledgeling's and his own,’ i.e. as παῖς

himself (ἔποψ). But the expression is
obscure as to be scarcely intelligible.</p>
<p>7 νέας ὀπώρας refers to the early part
of July, before the extreme heat of the
dog-star. Cf. Hes. Op. 597 δμωσὶ δ᾿
ἐποτρύνειν Δημήτερος ἱερὸν ἀκτὴν |
εὖτ᾿ ἂν πρῶτα φανῇ σθένος
χώρῳ ἐν εὐαέι καὶ ἐυτροχάλῳ ἐν ἀλωῇ.</p>
<p>8 ἀμψινωμήσει can scarcely mean
‘surround’ (Stephanus). Rather: ‘a
dappled pinion will guide (set in motion)
him οn either side.’ πτέρυξ side.’
is an intelligible variation of ὄρνις νωμᾷ
πτερόν (v. 4). Cf. Hesych. Ill p. 403
πτερονόμος· τοῖς πτεροῖς νομῶσα (1. νωμῶσα
[vel νέμουσα Dind.]) καὶ νεμομένη,
where the last word suggests πτερόνομος
as an alternative. Lobeck on Ai. 604
restored πτερόνωμος. πτέρυξ νωμᾷ is not
a less artificial inversion than Vergil's
vina cadis onerai (Aen. I. 195).</p>
<p>9 f. These lines seem to be echoed in
Aelian nat. an. 3. 26 οἱ ἔποπές εἰσιν ὀρνίθων

Καὶ μίσει τοῦ γένους τοῦ τῶν γυναικῶν

suggests that τῶνδ᾿ in the text refers
Procne and Philomela, from whom the
ἔποψ withdraws in loathing, with ἄπο
used as in fr. 583, 8. But ἐποικιεῖ
will not construe as it stands. Either
then (i) we should adopt Heath's τῶν δ᾿
ἀπαλλαγεὶς τόπων, with δρυμούς κτἑ. as
the direct object of ἀποικιεῖ, or (2) we
might read something like τῶνδ᾿
ἐΚ τόπων, with δρυμούς as ace. termini
like Pind. Pyth. 4. 258 τάν ποτε Καλλίσταν Ι
ἀπῴκησαν χρόνῳ | νᾶσον. M.
in Herm. XXVII 492 f. reads δαυλὸν εἰς
τόπον, followed by δρυμούς τ’, in order
to introduce a play upon the names of
the Megarian Pagae, Drymos, and Daulis;
and refers to Soph, the derivation
from δασύς recorded by Strabo 423 and
others.</p>

<p>In the matter of inter-aspiration the
practice of the Greeks was not constant,
but a medial aspirate is occasionally found
on Attic inscriptions in such words as
εὔὁρκος and πάρἑδρος: : Meisterhans3, p. 88.
The Alexandrian grammarians laid down
the rule that the aspirate should be
written only when the word was a true
compound, with each member retaining
a distinct force; but that if a single
notion had resulted, as would occur particularly
in the case of proper names, it
should be omitted. Thus they wrote
εὐαἵμων but Εὐαίμων, ἀμφίἁλος but Eὐρύαλος;
but there was not a complete
agreement about ὠκύαλος, because some
thought it a mere synonym of ὠΚύς. For
a full discussion see Thumb, Untersuch.

There was a temple of Helios
on the Thracian Chersonese (CIG add.
2016 d), but there does not appear to be
much evidence of the prevalence of his
cult in Thrace. Possibly the intention
was to classify the Thracians with other
barbarian sun-worshippers: see on fr.
752. Hiller v. Gaertringen thinks that
Sophocles described Thracian sun-worship
after Aeschylus in the Bassarae

<p>J. renders the whole passage as follows :
῾But now, separated from my home
(χωρίς), I am undone. Οften, indeed,
have I observed how miserable my sex
is in this respect. When we are girls,
our life in our father’s house is the
sweetest, methinks, that can fall to
mortal ; for the days of thoughtless childhood
are ever glad. But when we come
to years ΟΙ discretion, we are thrust out,
and sold in marriage far away from our
ancestral gods and from our parents; —
some of us to other parts of Hellas, some
to barbarians, some into houses where all
is strange (ἀήθη), some into places ΟΙ reproach.
And in all this, when once the
nuptial night is past, we must acquiesce,
and deem that it is well.’</p>
<p>I agree with F. W. Schmidt that the
tone of these verses recalls Euripides
rather than Sophocles, but they should
not be rejected in the face of the evidence
on mere suspicion. See also 1 Ρ. 62.</p>
<p>1 ff. These lines are open to suspicion
for several reasons: (1) the obscurity of
χωρίς, (2) the unusual meaning of ἔβλεψα
=ἐσκεψάμην or ἐφρόντισα, (3) the relation
of ταύτῃ, (4) the awkwardness of οὐδέν
ἐσμεν after οὐδέν εἰμι. J.'s translation
implies that χωρίς=χωρισθεῖσα, which,
although harsh, is possible grammatically
(Eur. Hclid. 321 n.); and that ταύτη
qualifies οὐδέν ἐσμεν and refers to χωρίς,
i.e. in respect of our separation from
home. It is possible, however, that ταύτῃ
looks forward (Jebb on O. C. 787) : ’this
is the view I have formed of womankind,
that we are naught.’ But in either case
the difficulty of finding a parallel to
ἔβλεψα remains, although fr. 302 is somewhat
similar, and Gomperz thinks it a
sufficient defence to refer to Dindorf’s
Lexicon. Cobet, Coll. Crit. p. 193,
whose brief comment is 'verba sensu
vacua,’ writes: νῦν δ᾿ οὐ δίειμι χωρίς...
ἐμεμψόμην δή (coll. Eur. fr. 84). F. W.
Schmidt and Wecklein, accepting οὐ δίειμι,
give νεωρές and πρῶτον (cf. Eur. Med. 292)
respectively for χωρίς, and the former also
proposes ἔψεξα ταὐτῇ. Μ. Schmidt conjectured
σοῦ δ᾿ for νῦν δ᾿, and Bergk ὦ
Χλωρίς for χωρίς. Herwerden wrote οὐ
νῦν δ᾿ ἐν ἡμῖν χωρίς. Herwerden wrote οὐ
This gives good sense, but is too violent
to be probable. Gomperz understood
χωρίς as prinatim, seorsum, i.e. invividually
rather than as belonging to the class
of women. He compares Eur. Hec. 860
χωρὶς τοῦτο κοὐ κοινὸν στρατῷ, but there
the contrast is much more clearly expressed.
Holzner's rendering 'I am not
isolated (or divided) in opinion ’ (coll.
Tr. fr. adesp. 482) is surely impossible.
For the general cast ΟΙ the sentence cf.
Eur. Hipp. 375 ἤδη ποτ᾿ ἄλλως νυκτὸς

worship of the phratries, the most important
mark of citizenship : see Plat.
Euthyd. 302 B, C. For the use in
Sophocles see Jebb on O.C. 756.— ἄπο,
away from, as in ἀπὸ θαλάσσης (Hdt. 4.

the like. There is no need for Blaydes's

<p>10 ἀηδῆ...ἐπίρροθα : see cr. n. J.
writes : ῾ἐπίρροθα, “open to reproach";
see on Ant. 413f. ἐπιρρόθοις | κακοῖσιν.
Tr. 263 πολλὰ μὲν λόγοις | ἐπερρόθησε.
Hesych. 11 p. 166 ἐπιρρόθητα· ἐπίψογα᾿
[Nauck conjectured ἐπίρροθα· τὰ ἐπίψογα,
which is to beg the question. Μ. Schmidt
also suspected a reference to this passage,
suggesting ἐπίρροθα· ἐπίρρητα, ἐπίψογα].
‘ The new home may be uncongenial to
the young wife either because it places
her among strange surroundings (ἀήθη) ;
or because it has unworthy or discreditable
associations (ἐπίρροθα).᾿ But the
antithesis is false, as Brunck remarked :
’quibuscunque moribus sit et qualicunque
fortuna utatur vir hospes vel barbarus,
cui puella nuptum datur, hand secus
insueta est, quo ducitur, domus. domus.’ Campbell
and others quote Eur. Med. 238 ἐς
καινὰ δ᾿ ἤθη καὶ νόμους ἀφιγμένην in support
of ἀήθη ; but, as it refers to marriage
generally from the woman's point of view,
it is really against them. Moreover, the
word ἐπίρροθος should mean rather abusive,
hostile, and it is a far cry to the
supposed sense flagitiosus, even if the
wofd can be used passively. The house
intended is that where the new-comer
will meet with nothing but fault-finding
and unfriendliness from the inmates.
The simplest correction of ἀληθῆ appears
to me to be ἀηδῆ, which, as I have since
found, has been anticipated by Wagner,
Seyffert, Meineke, and Headlam (J.P.
XXIII 272). Thus we get a natural contrast:
in the one case the wife is offended
by her new surroundings, and in the other
her κηδεσταί will not tolerate her intrusion.
In Trach. 869 ἀήθης appears to
be an error for ἀηδής (vulg.) or ἀγηθής
(Jebb); and in Eur. Hel. 418 I still think
that ἀηδίαν should take the place of
ἀηθίαν. Prinz's ἀκηδῆ (communicated to
me by Mekler) seems to mean 
'illkept.’</p>
<p>11f. The sentiment is based upon a
popular maxim : Eur. Tro. 665 καίτοι
λέγουσιν ὡς μί᾿ εὐφρόνη χαλᾷ | τὸ δυσμενὲς

<pb n="230"/>
γυναικὸς εἰς ἀνδρὸς λέχος. Cf. Trach. 149.
However that might be, the wife was
expected to show unqualified obedience:
Eur. El. 1053 γυμαῖκα γὰρ Χρὴ πάντα
συγχωρεῖν πόσει, | ἥτις φρενηρής. —
is hardly more than ‘to accept.’

<p>Welcker thinks that the line describes

Blaydes, who needlessly emends

that the ‘embroidered robe’ was the
garment which Philomela wove to inform
her sister (fr. 595). The sequence may

have been, ‘ (I asked of her) what she

<p>No doubt this was spoken with particular
reference to the Thracians (fr. 582),

the avarice of the kings of the Odrysae

The scribe's eye was deceived by the
homoioteleuton.</p>
<p>4 μεῖζον. Cobet (Coll. Crit. p. 194)
proposed to substitute χεῖρον, in order to
obtain the meaning ‘the remedy is worse
than the’ : but this is practically
the sense given by the text, if we recognize
that μεῖζον = ‘too strong (for the
disease),’ i.e. more powerful than its
warrants — ‘more grievous than the disease
itself.’ There is an excellent parallel
Aesch. Ag. 208 ἐπεὶ δὲ καὶ πικροῦ |
ἄλλο μῆχαρ | βριθύτερον
| μάντις ἔκλαγξεν. See also Ο.
438 (quoted by Ruehl) τὸν θυμὸν ἐκδραμόντα
μοι | μείζω κολαστὴν τῶν
ἡμαρτημένων, where however Jebb holds
that the gen. does not follow μείζω.
‘The sin of Tereus deserved chastisement,
but, by chastising it thus, the sisters
have “healed evil with evil." There is
an allusion to the proverb κακὸν κακῷ
ἰᾶσθαι.’ (J.) For the proverb see on
fr. 77. The unskilful physician uses
drugs which make the disease worse:
Plat. Ποί. 340 E ΚαΚὸν ἄρα μοι εἴργασται
..καὶ εἰμί τις γελοῖος ἰατρός·
μεῖζον τὸ νόσημα ποιῶ, Plut. cupid. div.
2 p. 523 E εἰπεῖν πρὸς τὸν πλοῦτον ὥσπερ
ἰατρὸν ἀλάζονα· ‘ τὸ φάρμακόν
τὴν νόσον μείζω ποιεῖ (Com. fr. adesp.
455 III 494 Κ.),’ Eur. fr. 292 πρὸς τὴν
νόσον τοι Καὶ τὸν ἰατρὸν χρεὼν |
ἀκεῖσθαι, μὴ ἐπιτὰξ τὰ φάρμακα | διδόντ᾿,
ἐὰν μὴ ταῦτα τῇ νόσῳ πρέπῃ.</p>
<p>5 κακῶν. Cobet wished to substitute
τέχνης for this word, and Gomperz ingeniously
conjectured ἀκῶν, which Nauck
adopted. But κακῶν, to be joined with
ἰατρός, is right, notwithstanding its awkwardness
after ἐν κακοῖσι (Jebb on Ο. C.
554). The allusion to the proverb mentioned
in the last note is continued.</p>

a Τυροῖ or Τυροῖ α΄, Buecheler Σοφ
Ἀτρεῖ. Hense points out that the lastnamed
title fits the alphabetical order of
plays followed by the anthologist, and that
the only reason for not accepting it is
that the Atreus is not elsewhere cited in
the collection). ‘θνητὰ...τετελέσθαι.’</p>
<p>1 The metre is defective, and the
best remedy that has been proposed is
Grotius's θνητὴν δὲ φύσιν χρὴ θνητὰ φρονεῖν.
Nauck thinks that θνητὴν δὲ φρονεῖν
Χρὴ θνητὰ φύσιν would be equally
good, but the separation of θνητὴν...φύσιν
is better avoided. When the same critic
goes on to speak of Meineke's θνητοὺς
φύντας or Hense's θνητὴν γενεάν as easier
changes which might be adopted, the
proposition is disputable. For the order
of the words to be shifted is a common
source of error, as Headlam and others
have shown; but that θνητοὺς φύντας
would be likely to become θνητὴν φύσιν,
or that γενεάν might be glossed by φύσιν,
it is difficult to believe. Campbell suggests
θνητὴν ψυχήν or θνητήν γε
ψυχή is hardly the right word, and,
though γε might be defended (e.g. by
Ai. 476), its position is not so unassailable
that it ought to be gratuitously introduced.
Buecheler deleted θνητὴν φύσιν
altogether. A more attractive proposal
is that of Schenkl (G.G.A. 1895, 485)
and Mekler to add ἱν after φύσιν. Cobet
(Coll. Crit. p. 195) pointed out that
θνητοὺς ὄντας was normal in this connexion,
and should be preferred to θνητοὺς
φύντας. — The sentiment is a maxim of
Greek proverbial philosophy which the
poets repeated with variations of phrase:

Aristotle criticizes it as a rule of life :

ἐφ᾿ ὅσον ἐνδέχεται ἀθανατίξειν καὶ πάντα

ἐν αὑτῷ. A merely sophistical refinement
appears in [Isocr.] 1. 32 ἀθάνατα μὲν
φρόνει τῷ μεγαλόψυχος εἶναι, θνητὰ δὲ
τῷ συμμέτρως τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ἀπολαύειν.</p>
<p>2 κατειδότας: for the plural, which 
is employed κατὰ σύνεσιν, cf. Phil. 356
στρατὸς | ἐκβάντα πᾶς ἠσπάζετ᾿, ὀμνύντες

<p>3 πλὴν Διός κτἑ. The Ajax ends
with the words ἦ πολλὰ βροτοῖς ἔστιν
ἰδοῦσιν | γνῶναι· πρὶν ἰδεῖν δ᾿ οὐδεὶς μάν-
τις | τῶν μελλόντων, ὅ τι πράξει, and it is 
highly probable, as Jebb thought, that we
have here the conclusion of the Tereus.
So in Eur. Med. 1415 the usual doxology
is introduced with the variation πολλῶν
ταμίας Ζεὺς ἐν Ὀλύμπῳ. The notion of 
Zeus (or the gods) as the only dispenser
of fortune is implicit in Thuc. 6. 78 οὐ
γὰρ οἷόν τε τῆς τε ἐπιθυμίας καὶ τῆς τύχης
τὸν αὐτὸν ὁμοίως ταμίαν γενέσθαι. Observe
that ταμίας as a verbal noun is 
followed by an indirect question (ὅτι χρὴ
τετελέσθαι), just as in Eur. Or. 1324 ἀλλά
μοι | φόβος τις εἰσελήλυθ᾿  ἥντιν᾿ ἐν δόμοις|
...κλύω βοήν the noun is used with the 
construction of φοβοῦμαι. Hence the 
so-called objective of connexion, and the 
phrase is incomplete without the subordinate
clause: cf. Thuc. 1. 61 ἡ ἀγγελία

Dorian strophe, affirming a principle

V. 2 is sound, the sense is : " The human
race is one; one day (cp. fr. 583, 11)
gave us our common origin from sire
and mother." More literally: "One
day brought forth all of us,—one human
kind,—from sire and mother." πατρός,
Uranos : ματρός, Gaia : from whom was
born lapetos, father Α Prometheus. (Or
perhaps the reference might be to Deu-

<p>The reference to the Titans seems farfetched:
the context rather requires the

affirmed as the result of all alike being
sprung from a human father and mother.

the words as they stand admit neither

is wanted might be obtained by the substitution
of ἁ γονά for ἁμέρα : ‘ our birth
from sire and mother proves us all,’
is the hall-mark of our equality. This
suggestion, which occurred independently
to the present editor, is due to Holzner,
and the same sense is given by Wecklein's
ἁ σπορά. Weil and Stadtmueller proposed
ἁρμογά, which Herwerden approved.
Badham (Praef. Eur. Ι. Τ. p. 12) preferred
μί᾿ ἔδειξεν &#x003C;ἑνὸς&#x003E; | καὶ πατρὸς Καὶ ματρὸς
ἐΚ μιᾶς | ἁμέρα κτἑ. Jebb's rendering of
ἔδειξε (ἔφυσε Blaydes) is difficult to support:
if sound, it must rather be used as
in ἀρχὴ ἄνδρα δείξει (Bias ap. Arist. eih.
Ν. 5. 1. 1130a 1), χρόνος δίκαιον ἄνδρα
δείκνυσιν μόνος (Ο Τ. 614).</p>
<p>3 ἔβλαστεν, ‘with ε, as in El. 440,
1095, and Phil. 131 1 : while in El. 238
(ἐν τίνι τοῦτ᾿ ἔβλαστεν ἀνθρώπων) the ε is
long.’ (J.)</p>
<p>4 ff. ‘But, though men are thus equal
by origin, there is a great inequality in
their fortunes.’ (J.) Cf. Pind. Nem. 7
2 ff. ἄνευ σέθεν (sc. Εἰλειθυίας) οὐ...ἐλάχομεν
| ἀγλαόγυιον Ἥβαν. | ἀναπνέομεν δ’
οὐΧ ἅπαντες ἐπὶ ἴσα· | εἴργει δὲ πότμῳ
ζυγένθ᾿ ἕτερον ἕτερα. Observe how the
closing phrase re-echoes the first of the
two preceding and contrasted clauses.
This is a characteristic device of Sophoclean
style: see Jebb on Ο. T. 338, Ant.
465 ff. — βόσκει, with contemptuous or
pitying tone: see on fr. 140. Here we
might render: ‘ To some a doom of evil
days is their ’ (Psalm 42. 3 my tears
have been my meat day and night. ) — On
the ground that vv. 4 — 6 ought to correspond
metrically with vv. i — 3 Nauck
assumed that a lacuna existed after δουλείας
to be filled with such words as ἐν
αὐλαῖς ἀλλοτρίαις or other metrical equinalent.
For the same reason he altered
ἔσχεν to ἴσχ’. So H. conjectured τοὺς
δὲ δουλείᾳ σ &#x003C;υνοίκους | ἀργαλέας&#x003E; ζυγὸν
ἴσχ’ ἀνάγκας after Bacchyl. 11. 72.
Gleditsch (Cantica, p. 227), reading
ἔξοχος ἄλλου ἔβλαστεν in v. 3, makes
correspondence by continuing here ἡμῶν
&#x003C;καὶ κράτος&#x003E;· ἄλλους δὲ δουλείας κτἑ.
But the sense is complete as the text
stands, for δουλείας (δουλίας or
Blaydes) may well be an adjective qualifying
ἀνάγκας; and the metrical assumption
stands in need of justification. Tucker
(C. R. XVII 191), who rewrites v. 2 f . as
καὶ ματρὸς ἀρμὰ (‘union’) πάντας· ἄλλος
ἔξοχος | οὐΚ ἔβλαστεν ἄλλου proposes
ἐξ ἀνάγκας in v. 6. — ἔσχεν : the aor. is
ingressive (‘seized’). See Jebb on
331.</p>
<p>H. renders as follows:
‘We are one from fiAther and mother.
All human children of earth;
Not one more high than another,
Or lower babe at his birth:
But the daily food of his living
Is that which Destiny gave;
And Weal or Woe is her giving.
Or hardest yoke of the slave.’
The metre is prosodiac-enhoplic and the
scheme as follows:
<lg>
<l>— — &#x23D1; — — — &#x23D1; &#x23D1; — &#x23D1; &#x23D1; —</l>

The concluding phrase — an adoneus in
place of a choriambus — is the same as
in Ai. 181 at the end of a similar system.
The character of the rhythm resembles
that of Trach. 94 ff. For the metre

Τηρεῖ. ‘τὰν...ὥραις’ (vv. 4—6).
Relying on the similarity of meaning as
well as on the exact metrical correspondence
of the two passages, Bergk conjectured
that vv. 1—3 were to be assigned
to the Tereus, and were antistrophic to
vv. 4—6. His view was accepted by
and Nauck, and the latter printed
the lines as if they were consecutive, but
with vv. 4—6 standing first.
original view was that τὰν γὰρ...ὥραις
followed immediately after ζυγὸν ἴσχεν
ἀνάγκας (fr. 591), and completed the
strophe, and that ἀλλᾶ τῶν...πλοῦτον
was the corresponding portion of the
antistrophe.] It is difficult to see how
the words ἀλλὰ...πλοῦτον, which should
contain a qualification of or exception to
what precedes, can properly follow a
statement that human life is continually
shifting to sorrow. If therefore the lines
are continuous, I should prefer to suppose
that vv. 4—6 came last, explaining
reason why unrighteous prosperity is precarious.
The evidence is not conclusive
that the two passages are closely conncted,
still less that they stood originally
in immediate proximity to each other.
Nevertheless, Bergk's conjecture has a
high degree of probability, and it is
convenient to print the lines together in
view of the similarity of their contents.</p>
<p>The leading thought is that Wealth,
although not necessarily an evil in itself,
is always a source of danger leading to
temptation. The reckless want of prudence
which is natural to the over-rich
man gives their opportunity to the cunning
agents of Destruction, who are waiting to
overthrow his prosperity. The extract
reads like a familiar echo of Aesch. Ag.

Πειφώ, | προβούλου παῖς ἄφερτος Ἄτας
see Headlam's masterly exposition in
Cambridge Praelections, pp. 114—118.
But the standpoint of the two poets is
different: Sophocles moralizes in a tone
of mournful resignation, Aeschylus with
the fervour of an inspired preacher.</p>
<p>1 ff. τῶν πολλῶν καλῶν τίς χάρις:
‘what delight is there in (his) high good
fortune?’ So Eur. Med. 226 οἴχομαι
Καὶ βίου | χάριν μεθεῖσα κατθανεῖν
and other examples quoted by Blaydes on
Ar. Lys. 865. Cf. Aesch. Ag. 362 πολλῶν
γὰρ ἐσθλῶν τὴν ἔησι εἱλόμην. — For πολλῶν
καλῶν see on fr. 938. — κακόβουλος
φροντίς is the opposite of βαθείας φροντίδος
σωτηρίου in Aesch. Suppl. 412. Its
manifestation is the Aeschylean ὕβρις:
Eutn. 536 δυσσεβίας μὲν ὕβρις τέκος ὡς
ἐτύμως, | ἐΚ δ’ ὑγιείας | φρενῶν
φίλος | καὶ πολύευκτος ὄλβος. The
spirit is that of arrogant self-seeking:
Pers. 826 μηδέ τις | ὑπερφρονήσας
παρόντα δαίμονα | ἄλλων ἐρασθεὶς
ἐκχέῃ μέγαν. It is another aspect of the
theme that ill-gotten gains are soon spent:
see on Eur. Hel. 905, Headlam in Journ.
Phil. XXIII 275 f. The distraction of the
mind is a sign of impending ruin: Aesch.
Suppl. 116, Lys. 6. 22 καίτοι πῶς οὐ θεῶν
τις τὴν τούτου γνώμην διέφθειρεν ; ‘The
sentiment applies to the subject of the
play. The guilt of Tereus towards Philomela,
and the crime of the avenging

<pb n="236"/>
sisters, combined to ruin all three.’
—ἐκτρίψει : see cr. n. ‘Verse 6 shows
that a molossus ( – – – ) is required, (1)
Bergk conj. ἐκστρίψει, which might be
taken as in Ar. Nub. 88 ἔκστρεψον ὡς
τάχιστα τοὺς σαυτοῦ τρόπους, “turn
out," completely change. In Ιl. 17. 58
βόθρου τ’ ἐξέστρεψε, a wind wrests the
tree from its place in the ground — uproots
it. The metaphor of uprooting would,
however, be somewhat obscure here without
further explanation. (2) Herwerden
conj. ἀντρέψει, “οverthrow.” Cp. Aesch.
Pers. 163 f. μὴ μέγας δαίμων κονίσας οὖδας
ἀντρέψῃ ποδὶ | ὄλβον. But the
is that the genuine word began with
ἐΚ.’ (J.) The best conjecture is Tucker's
ἐκτρίψει (anticipated by Herwerden, Exerc.
Crit. p. 23), which I have adopted. Cf.
Ο. T. 428. The possible claim of ἐκτρέψει
(φ and ψ confused: Cobet
p. 782), which would be the easiest alteration,
must be rejected. ἐκτρέπειν is
to turn aside, divert; and, even if the
words would bear the meaning, the idea
of diverting wealth which is the source
of happiness to a harmful purpose is
foreign to the thought. Wealth is not
regarded as an instrument to be well or
ill applied, but as a secure endowment
which is imperilled by sinful conduct. —
τὸν εὐαίωνα πλοῦτον is wealth as the
necessary condition of prosperity, in itself
harmless: Aesch. Pers. 171 ἔστι γὰρ
πλοῦτός γ᾿ ἀμεμφής, Ag. 477 κρίνω
ἄφρονον ὄλβον. So we read in the case
of Oedipus at the summit of his fortune
of τοῦ πάντ᾿ εὐδαίμονος ὄλβου (O.
1198).</p>
<p>4 γάρ : see cr. n. It occasionally
happens that δέ has been substituted for
γάρ, as here (Cobet, Ν. L. p. 419); but
the converse case is far more common
(Headlam, On editing Aeschylus, p. 119).</p>
<p>5 f. ποικιλομήτιδες ἆται πημάτων,
‘lit. “wily mischiefs of calamity.”
genitive is one of quality, or definition =
πήματα φέρουσαι. The Homeric epithet
of Odysseus is given to the ἆται, ecause
these mischiefs are half-personified, as
subtle tempters of men's minds. Cf. v. ’
(J.) There are similar half-personifications
in Aesch. Ag. 765, Cho. 465 Καὶ
παράμουσος ἄτας | αἱματόεσσα
Stronger is Ag. 397 προβούλου παῖς
ἄφερτος Ἄτας. For the gen. cf. Aesch.
Cho. 584 δειμάτων ἄχη, Eur. Hel. 1055
σωτηρίας ἄκος.—πάσαις...ὥραις, ‘at all
seasons.’ ‘Burges conj. αὔραις
ever-varying winds of fortune"): Lehrs,
μεταλλάσσουσι μορφαῖς, which might be
taken with πημάτων: “with all forms of
calamity." I do not see the need of
emendation.’ (J.)</p>

εἰς Ἀίδεω. See also on Eur. Phoen.
555.—ἀποβλέψαι, which in classical Greek
is usually accompanied by εἰς or πρός, appears
here to govern a single accusative.
The word does not occur elsewhere in
Sophocles. Blaydes conj. ἄνδρ᾿ ἐς τὸν
for ἀνθρώπων. The text is open to suspicion,
but it should be observed that the 
passive use of ἀποβλέπεσθαι in Ar. Eccl.
726, the verbal ἀπόβλεπτος in Eur. Hec.
355, and the co-ordination with other
transitive verbs in Dem. 19. 265 οὐχ ὅπως
...κολάζειν ἠξίουν τοὺς ταὺτα παιοῦντας, ἀλλ᾿ 
ἀπέβλεπον, ἐζήλουν, ἐτίμων, ἄνδρας ἡγοῦντο
show that ἀποβλέπειν was tending to bear 
a transitive force. In late Greek the usage
is well established: cf. Philostr. Vit Apoll.
5.24 προΐοντα θεῷ ἴσα ἀπέβλεπον. Lucian
vit. auct. 10 οὕτω γὰρ ἀποβλέψονταί σε καὶ
ἀνδρεῖον ὑπολήψονται. Anth. Pal. 9. 283
Ἄλπεις | αἵ ῾Ρήνου προχοὰς ἐγγὺς ἀποβλέπετε.
But in Theophr. fr. 8 de vertig. 8
ἰλιγγιῶσι δὲ καὶ οἱ τὰ ὑψηλὰ καὶ τὰ μεγάλα
καὶ ἀπότομα ἀποβλέποντες the meaning is
'to look down from a height.' If a change
were required, πρός for ποτ᾿ would be the
simplest.—τανυφλοίου κτἑ.: 'For shortlived
as the leaves of the slender poplar
a man sheds his life' (J.). Some allusion
to the leaves of the poplar appears to be 
necessary, since the lines are only a particular
application of the famous simile in
Hom. Z 146. But, inasmuch as ἀποβάλλει
requires a personal subject, I have
preferred φύλλοις τις to φύλλοισιν (see cr.
n.): τις is then collective, as in Ai. 965
(with J.'s note). J. was inclined either to read 
ἀνθρώπου in v. 1 or to substitiute τις
κλῶσιν for ὅστις; but the latter is open to 
the objection that the κλῶνες do not perish
every season. Duentzer omitted γὰρ and
retained ὅστις. With respect to the meaning
of τανυφλοίου, J. writes: 'Il. 16. 767
τανύφλοιόν τε κράνειαν (“smooth-barked
cornel-tree,” A. Lang). Leaf ad loc. says,
“with thin bark.” He remarks that 
“thin” or “smooth” generally suit the 
compounds of τανυ-indifferently, and are
prefereble to “long,” though this is the 
sense of ταναός. But the traditional explanation
of τανύφλοιος as='with longstretched 
bark,’ i.e. ‘of tall or slender
growth’ (L. and S.) appears to be correct
here. J. quotes Hom. η 106 οἷά τε φύλλα
μακεδνῆς αἰγείροιο, κ 510 μακραί τ᾿  αἴγειροι.</p>
<p>4ff ‘Let a man so live as to provide
best for the happiness of each day: the
event, of the morrow ever comes unfore- 
seen.’—ζώοι: see cr. n. The Ionic form 
occurs in El. 157, and O. C. 1213, so that
it seems unnecessary to change it.—For
the collective τις with jussive verb cf. Eur.

τις τοκέων σέβας εὖ προτίων...ἔστω, Xen.

similar to that of Matth. 6. 34 μὴ οὖν μεριμνήσητε

ἑαυτῆς· ἀρκετὸν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἡ κακία αὐτῆς:

the medium of information, Achilles (5. 3)
describes a picture of the outrage as actually
embroidered on the robe. Moreover
the latter represents Philomela as present
while Procne examines the picture: that,
at any rate, cannot be Sophoclean. Note

<p>ΤΡΙΠΤΟΛΕΜΟΣ</p>
<p>Pliny (η. h. 18. 65 = Soph. fr. 5ΟΟ) states that the Triptolemus
was produced 145 years before the death ΟΙ Alexander, Since
Alexander died in 323 B.C., the date of the Triptolemus is
accordingly fixed as 468 B.C. If Pliny’s remark is to be construed
strictly, the Triptolemus was put on the stage in the year before
the production of the Septem contra Thebas of Aeschylus. It has
been observed that the fragments of the Triptolemus recall the
Prometheus Vinctus, not only by reason of the structure and compass
of the speech in which Demeter despatched Triptolemus on
his mission, but also by the appearance of the particular phrase
addressed by Prometheus to Io 1 The date of the Prometheus is
uncertain, and some recent authorities place it later than 468 B.C.2
They do not seem to have noticed that, if the relevance of the
Sophoclean fragments is admitted, there can be no question
which of the two poets was the imitator. Although there is
no good reason for discrediting Pliny’s evidence, Welcker 3
minimized its importance by interpreting it to mean only that
the subject of Triptolemus was handled by Sophocles, who
commenced to write for the stage in 468 For that year, in
which Apsephion was archon, was famous as the occasion of the
first appearance of Sophocles in the Dionysiac contest at the age
of 28, when he was adjudged the first prize to the chagrin of
Aeschylus4 There are, in any case, sufficient grounds for
believing that the Triptolemus was an early work, belonging to a
time when the author was still largely influenced by the manner
of his great predecessor. We should not therefore be surprised
to find in it a plot free from complicated action, together with an
abundance of narrative and description.</p>
<p>The scene of the play was almost certainly Eleusis Triptolemus
is an Eleusinian chieftain in Hom. h. Dem. 153, which is
the earliest mention ΟΙ his name, and is one of those to whom
the institution of the Eleusinian mysteries was entrusted (ib. 474).
But the Homeric hymn, in which Triptolemus only appears
incidentally, was not the source ΟΙ the play οf Sophocles.</p>
<p>The later authorities, who, of course, drew upon Attic
sources, agree in representing Triptolemus as the favourite of

which had been first bestowed upon Attica. Cf. Ov. Trist. 3. 8. 2

throughout Greece see Pausan. 7. 18. 2, 8. 4. i. The orators were
never weary of pointing out to their audience the distinction of
Attica as the original home of agriculture2.</p>
<p>But there was a wide-spread divergence of opinion concerning;
the identity of Triptolemus, as may be seen from the variant
accounts given in Pausan. I. 14. 2 3. This shows that, though his
civilizing mission was accepted as beyond question, the story of
Triptolemus did not rest upon any dominant literary tradition.
How then did Sophocles treat the subject ? From the fragments
themselves all that can be made out with certainty is that the
play contained a description of the journey of Triptolemus over
the earth in the chariot drawn by serpents. Frs. 597 — 599, and
possibly also frs. 600–604, belong to the speech of
Several of the words or phrases refer to crops, or articles of diet :
see frs. 606—610 4. But we must look elsewhere for indications
of the tragic conflict, which must somehow or other have been
connected with the favour shown to Triptolemus. (i) Gruppe,
Ariadne, p. 358, found it in the story of Lyncus, the Scythian
king, who, as related by Ov. Met. 5. 642 — 661, attempted to put
Triptolemus to death, in order to supplant him, and was subsequently
transformed into a lynx. (2) Petersen, in a review of
Welcker, treated Charnabon (fr. 604 n.) as the chief opponent 5
It is unnecessary to discuss these suggestions, in view of what
<note type="footnote">1 It is altogether improbable that this was an invention of Sophocles : see Gruppe,

<pb n="241"/>
will presently be said about Welcker's theory. (3) Welcker
found sf clue to the chief subject of the tragedy in the concluding
part of Hygin. fab. 147. The other authorities which contain
the same story are Serv. Verg. Georg. 1. 19, schol. Stat. Theb. 2. 382
and Mythogr. Vat. 11 99. It is said that, after Triptolemus had
returned from his journey, a king named Cepheus or Celeus
sought to kill him through jealousy, but was compelled by
Demeter to yield his kingdom to her favourite. Triptolemus is
represented as the son of Eleusinus, and is declared to have
founded a town called Eleusis after his father, who had instituted
in honour of Demeter the feast known as Thesmophoria.
Welcker’s view was accepted by Preller (Myth. I p. 636) and by
H. W. Stoll in Roscher II 1028, but it involves the difficulty that if
the drama included the departure of Triptolemus, as well as the
successful issue of the conflict after his return, the unity of time
was destroyed 1. Welcker frankly admitted this, but claimed
the successful completion of the adventurous journey rather than
its inception deserved to be represented, and that the foundation
of the Eleusinia was subsequent to the spread of agriculture over
the world by Triptolemus. He escaped from the dilemma by the
assumptions that Triptolemus on his return himself described
how he had been despatched on his mission by Demeter, and
that the goddess was not represented on the stage at this period
of the action. The expedient is hardly successful. I think that,
if any one will examine frs. 597—599 without prejudice, he will
hesitate to conclude that they are all taken from a speech of
Triptolemus describing the nature of the commission which was
assigned to him. Moreover, Welcker’s assumption contradicts
the express statement of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (fr. 598),
that Sophocles put Demeter on the stage giving directions to
Triptolemus concerning the lands which he would have to
traverse in spreading abroad the bounty of the goddess. It is
unreasonable to reject the single piece of trustworthy evidence
which bears on the plot in favour of a mere guess—for it is
nothing more—that the conflict with Cepheus provided the
climax of the action. So far from agreeing with Welcker that
the departure of Triptolemus could not have formed the conclusion
of the play, I believe that the gift of corn was the main
theme to which the rest of the action was subordinate. The
momentous character of the commission entrusted to Triptolemus,
and the lustre which it shed upon Attica in the eyes of posterity,
combined to make his departure on a divinely ordered journey
eminently suitable as the finale of a play in which the young

Aeschylus as a similar case.</note>

<pb n="242"/>
dramatist sought to celebrate the Eleusinian hero for the first
time before a wider public. But that which chiefly needed
explanation was the reason why Triptolemus had been so highly
blessed. In order to discover an answer, we must return to the
domestic history of Celeus, the Eleusinian, whose house was
honoured by a visit from Demeter, when, disguised as an old
woman, she was mourning for the loss of Persephone. In the
Homeric hymn the daughters of Celeus found her at the ’Maiden
’ and introduced her as nurse to their infant brother
Demophon. Metanira, the mother, was alarmed by the strange
proceedings of the goddess, who stealthily by night bathed the
child in the fire, in order to make him immortal. So she cried
aloud in dismay ; but Demeter was wroth with her, and put
down the child. Before leaving the house, she revealed herself,
and explained how the ’s folly had frustrated her ’s
happiness. This story was subsequently combined with the local
tradition which made Triptolemus the minister of Demeter s
bounty. Thus in Ov. Fast. 4. 507 — 560 the ’s name has
been changed to Triptolemus, and the goddess, when interrupted,
promises that he shall be the first man to plough and sow, — as a
compensation for the loss of his immortality. In Hygin. fab.
147 the facts are similar, but the ’s name, as we have seen,
is different, and he is killed by the goddess in anger. There is
good reason to suppose that this version goes back to Panyassis
(EGF Ρ. 263). The death of the father, who however is called
Celeus, is mentioned also in Nonn. 19. 85, where Demeter con-
soles Triptolemus and Metanira. But the death of Celeus
seems to have occurred after the gift of corn, although the
description is far from clear ; and the story perhaps ran parallel
to the legend of Icarius. In Apollod. 1. 31 f the mother
interrupts, as in the hymn, with the result that the child
(Demophon) was consumed in the flames. Demeter then provided
the winged car for Triptolemus, the elder of Metanira's
children, and gave him wheat to sow over the whole world. It
is obvious that, if Triptolemus was to be made the hero of a play,
and the events which led to his mission were to be included in
the scope of the action, the version preserved in Apollodorus
was alone suitable for the purposed It is therefore suggested
that the identification of Triptolemus with the elder son of
Metanira may have been taken from Sophocles, and that the
earlier part of his play included the coming of Demeter to
Eleusis, and the failure of her first attempt to reward the hospi-
tality of Celeus.</p>

Triptolemus rode in the winged car.

should, however, be mentioned that in

name given to the side-boards which
form part of the ὑπερτερία or body of the
car. — ἀμφιπλίξ is glossed by περιβάδην
(see above), and here suggests that the
serpents drew the car by holding the axle
within their grip, that is to say, by coiling
themselves round it (ὢσπερ ἄν εἰ
περιβεβηκότε τὸν θαιρόν). The word
means strictly ’ having the legs a-straddle ’
(Achill. Tat. 1. 1: Europa riding on the
bull, οὐ περιβάδην ἀλλὰ κατὰ πλευράν),
and is the exact equivalent οf ἀμφιβάντ’

<p>The extract is taken from the speech
of Demeter to Triptolemus. — J. thus
paraphrases Dionysius : ‘after mentioning
eastern Italy first — which extends from
the lapygian promontory to the Sicilian
strait (πορθμοῦ) — she next touches
Sicily, which lies opposite; then she
returns to Italy, taking the western coast,
and enumerates the principal nations who
dwell on that seaboard, beginning with
the settlements of the Oenotri.’</p>
<p>1 τὰ δ’ ἐξόπισθε. ‘(1) Ellendt and
L. and S. take this as = “thereafter,”
deinceps, as ἐξοπίσω is used in Od. 4. 35,
and often in other poets, (2) It might
also mean "to the west," if Triptolemus
is supposed to be moving down the east
coast. But, as it ought to come next
after the mention of Sicily, this seems
less ’ So J. writes, remarking in
respect of χειρὸς ἐς rd δεξιά that
’Triptolemus may be supposed to have
arrived in Sicily, and to be facing westward.
The west coast of Italy would
then be on his right.’ The supposition appears
arbitrary, and the explanation of τὰ
ἐξόπισθε open to grave doubt; for the
close connexion with χειρὸς ἐς τὰ δεφιά
favours a local rather than a temporal
meaning, and the run of the sentence
suggests that it is the subject and not an
adverbial accusative. Further, there is
no evidence that ὀπίσω etc. can mean
’the ’ On the contrary ὀπίσθια
denotes the east in Cleomed. arc.

τῇ ἀνατολῇ· ἀπὸ τούτων γὰρ ἐπὶ τὸ
ἔμπροσθεν πρόεισιν (sc. ὁ κόσμος) : but this
is a technical (Stoic) passage, which has
little bearing on the interpretation of
Sophocles. For these reasons I conclude
that, although the words ἐς τὰ δεξιά relate
to χειρός (Theocr. 28. 18 τεῆς ἐπὶ δεξιὰ
χειρός, Ηοm. h. Herm. 153 χέλυν ἐρατὴν
ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ χειρὸς ἐέργων), the latter is
also to be connected with ἐξόπισθε, and
that this is established by fr. 534 ἐξοπίσω
χερός. So Bacchyl. 13. 10 τὸ πὰρ χειρός
of what is close at hand, and similar
phrases, in which χειρός expresses the
local relation of the person in question,
although the mention of the hand as a
separate member has no particular sighificance.
Cf. ὑπὸ ὑπὸ κεῖρα, ἀνὰ χεῖρα, and
so forth. The meaning is simply ’the
regions lying behind you on the right.’
and the words τὰ...δεξιά form the subject,
to which Οἰνωτρία...γῆ is attributive.
We are thus required to imagine
Triptolemus as situated on the Italian
side of the straits of Messina and looking
towards Sicily : that this position was
contemplated by the speaker is suggested
by the words in which Dionysius refers
to Sicily as τῆς ἀντικρύ (supra).</p>
<p>2f. Οἰνωτρία...πᾶσα, ‘ he is to traverse
it from end to end. This name was
given by the Greeks to the western seaboard
of Italy from the straits as far
north as the gulf of Paestum, thus
including Bruttium and Lucania. The
region north of Oenotria was called by
the Greeks Opikia (Kiepert, Hellas,
map 11) north of that came Tyrrhenia.
The name TraXta was with the Greeks

<p>The fertility of the Italian corn-lands,
as compared with those of their own
country, was well known to the Greeks.
Polybius (2. 15) instances the cheapness
of wheat in his own time as a proof of
the abundance of corn grown in Italy;
and Strabo (242) praises the productiveness
of Campania. The Athenians, who
lived principally on imported corn (Dem.
20. 31), proposed in the year 325—324 Β.C.
to found a colony on the shore of the
Adriatic for the purpose of the corn-trade
(CIA II 809; Dittenberger, Syll.2 153).</p>
<p>No doubt εὐδαίμονα was the original of
fortunatam: cf. Pausan. 1. 12. 1 τήν τε

Schmidt preferred to write Ἰλλυρὶς γονῆ·
γονέα, which is hardly intelligible.
Musurus was surely right : so τριτοσπόρῳ
γονῇ in Aesch. Pers. 820 is explained by
schol. Μ as τρίτῃ τῶν μεταγενεστέρων
γενεᾳ.</p>
<p>It is hazardous to guess at the context,
but it is probably safe to infer that γονή
had a concrete sense, perhaps that of
produce. Illyria was famous for cattle
rather than corn: see [Arist.] mir. ausc.
128, quoted by Grote ΙΙΙ Ρ. 423. We
cannot tell what moved Callistratus to
support the variant γύη; but it is surprising
to find the authority of an early
Alexandrian cited in favour of the fern.
γύη, which since ’s note on Eur.
Hclid. 839 has been always condemned
as a late error. γυνή was probably a
mere blunder ; and it is worthy of mention
that γύναι and γοναί are variants
the genuine γύαι in Αnt. 569.</p>

<p>Cobet conjectured from κράσπεδες the

to Schwartz] κράσπεδ᾿ ἔστ᾿. B. ἀσπάζομαι,
but it is very unlikely, as van Leeuwen
remarked (de Soph. Ai. authentia, p. 38),
that Sophocles in his earliest play divided
a line between two speakers in this way.
Blaydes, suspecting KpdaireSa, suggested
πάγκαρπα πεδί᾿, or the like. Hermann,
followed by Ahrens, read προστάτην. It
is to be regretted that the quotation breaks
off so abruptly : why did Demeter, if she
is the speaker, take occasion to greet the
name of Carthage ? Since the Triptolemus
was an early play, it must be remembered
that the name of Carthage had become
familiar to the Greeks at the end of the
Persian wars in consequence of the simultaneous
struggle waged by their kinsmen
in Sicily against the Punic invaders. The
anachronism mentioned by the schol. need
not trouble us : although the name does
not occur elsewhere in tragedy, many believe
that Carthage is referred to in Eur.
Phoen. 204. Eudoxus of Cnidos (c. 365
B.C.) is quoted immediately before the
above extract in connexion with the
foundation of Carthage, but a century
earlier Sophocles may well have treated
the settlement as being of immemorial
antiquity.—For κράσπεδ᾿ cf. Eur. fr. 381

<p>H. points out that εἶδος here must surely
mean a kind οf plant, i.e. εἶδος Λιβυκόν
not εἶδος τῆς Λιβύης. The text, he sugests,
has either arisen from a var. lect.
περὶ τῆς Λιβύης τὸ σίλφιον φερούσης, which
has somehow or other attached itself in
part to εἶδος, or else there is a lacuna,
e.g. oἳ δὲ εἶδος &#x003C;Ἡρόδοτος δὲ μέρος&#x003E; τῆς
Λιβύης τὸ σίλφιον, for Herodotus (4. 169
192) uses τὸ σίλφιον of the district where
the silphium grew. According to Theophrastus
(hist. pl. 6. 3. 3) and Pliny (n.
h. 5. 33) the region was 4000 stadia
square. Leutsch, however, in rejecting
Schott’s proposed addition of βοτάνης,
suggests that εἶδος is used in the sense of
spice (‘speciem odoratam, cuius generis
erat silphium : sic enim proprie τὸ εἴδη
recentioribus sunt usitata’).</p>
<p>What σίλφιον (laserpicium = lac sirpicum
‘milk of silphium,’ or laser piceum)
really was has long been a matter of conjecture.
jecture. John Evelyn and Bentley (see his
Correspondence, 11 p. 234 f.) thought it was
the large umbelliferous plant of Persia and
the East Indies (Ferula or Narthex asafoetida):
see Ellis on Catull. 7. 4, Sennenschein
on Plant. Rud. 630. It was largely
used in Greek cookery and also as a
medicine ; and the demand for it was
the principal reason of the prosperity of
Cyrene, with which town it is always
connected. The trade subsequently decayed,
but for what reason is unknown
(Neil on Ar. Eq. 893). Ridgeway (Early
Age of Greece, pp. 223-228) suggests that
σίλφιον is to be identified with the Homeric
lotus-plant, the legend οf which is
the embodiment of a vague tradition that
on the north coast of Africa fronting the
Syrtis there grew a plant elsewhere unknown
but possessing rare virtues.</p>

who is a doublet of the Scythian Lyncus
(Ov. Met. 5. 645) and of the Eleusinian
Celeus or Cepheus (Hygin. fab. 147), is
otherwise unknown; but Carnabas is the
name given by Eustath. II. p. 448, 8 to
the Perrhaebian who took refuge at Zeleia
in the Troad, after killing his father
Triopas. Curiously enough Triopas is
confused with Charnabon in a schol. on
Ov. Met. 2. 138, and an extract quoted
by Ellis on Ov. Ib. 287. These two
passages were pointed out by Knaack in
Jahrb. f. Philol. cxxxv (1887) 318 f., but
are not of any independent value in explaining
the tradition which Sophocles
followed. — This is the earliest reference
to the Getae : cf. Hdt. 4. 93. The transference
of the Balkan tribe to Mysia may
be connected with the flight of Carnabas
to Zeleia. For migration between Thrace
and Mysia see Macan on Hdt. 7. 20.</p>

<p>The personification of Δαίς is literary
rather than religious, as is shown by the
adoption of the Homeric epithet (γ
etc.). Similar deifications of abstract
ideas in Sophocles are πειθώ in fr. 865
λοιμός in Ο. T. 27, Φάμα, daughter of
Ἐλπίς, in Ο. Τ. 157, and Διὸς Ὅρκος in

Hes. Τheog. 231, and Gruppe, Gr. Myth.

had much to do with the growth of these
abstract deities. irpeo-pto-TTj here points
to the same influence : cf. Hes. Theog.

to describe abstract ideas has sunk almost
to the level of a stylistic mannerism : see

play is preserved by Athen. 67 C Σοφοκλῆς
Τριπτολέμῳ· ῾τοῦ ταριχηροῦ γάρου.᾿ Cf.
[Herodian] Philetaer. (in Moerised. Pierson,
p. 437) ὁ γάρος ἀρσενικῶς ῾τὸν ἰχθύων
γάρον᾿ (Aesch. fr. 211) καὶ γάρον τὸν ἰχθύειον
Σοφοκλῆς. If the context of these
passages is examined, there is not much
doubt that they are all ultimately deduced
from the same lexicographical source ;
and, though the quotation of Pollux is
the fullest, it is not unlikely that the
words Μ by Athenaeus are correct.
In that case Pollux or his immediate
authority may have quoted loosely and
without giving the true order of the
words : the original may have been οὐδ’
ἡ τάλαινα τοῦ ταριχηροῦ γάρου | δοῦσ᾿.
The common origin of the three sources
renders improbable the view to which
Headlam, Blaydes, and Mekler inclined,
that Herodian’s γάρον τὸν ἰχθύειον should
be quoted as a fragment distinct from
that preserved by Pollux and Athenaeus.
The φιλεταῖρος is a sorry abridgement
which does not justify the attribution of
ἰχθύειος to Sophocles. It should be
stated that Diintzer regarded δοῦσα as
a corruption of τοῦ. J. writes: ῾I should
conj. δαίς: "nor the wretched feast on a
preserve of salt fish" (when the gifts of
Triptolemus have come, this will be the
people’s portion no more).᾿ In that case
δαίς would be ironical, like the βραχεῖα
δαίς of Menedemus (Lycophr. fr. 3, TGF
p. 818), who sometimes served ταρίχιον to
his guests. Meineke restored a trochaic

ἡ τάλαινα, δὸς τ. γ. Blomfield’s τάλαιν᾿
ἁλοῦσα ταρχηροῦ is meaningless. — γάρου,
a sort Οf caviare, made of brine and
pickled fish. See the commentators on
Hor. Sat. 2. 8. 46 garo de sucis piscis
Iberi. Zahn in Pauly- Wissowa VII 841 ff.
shows that there were many varieties of
γάρος (garum), and that it was by no
means exclusively a luxury.</p>

it is spoken of contemptuously as the

and Miss Harrison has noticed (Prol.

national drink of Hellas even in primitive

contempt for barbarian beer-drinkers

means ’muddy,’ i.e. coming from the
earth and not maturing like the grape in
the open air, for I can see no point in
the ’landsman’s beer’ (Hartung). But

<p>Welcker's (p. 308) defence of Sophocles
is unconvincing: he suggests that the
verse refers not to a trivial incident of
ordinary life, but to the feasts of the
initiated at the Eleusinian mysteries. We
are, however, perhaps justified in recalling
that the play was probably an
early one (see Introductory Note). — The
wine-cooler, ψυκτήρ, also called δῖνος, is
thus described by Poll. ὁ. 99 οὐ μὴν ἒχει

discover, there is no other early evidence
of a connexion between the worship of
the two goddesses, and it is interesting
to find Sophocles taking notice of what
appears to be a philosophical speculation
based on the supposed etymology of
Hestia. It should be added that the
Pythagoreans called their central fire by
the names Ἑστία τοῦ παντός and μήρηρ

<p>ΤΡΩΙΛΟΣ</p>
<p>Troilus is mentioned by Homer as one of the sons whom
Priam had lost, in a passage (Ω 257) where the epithet
is taken to indicate his prowess as a warrior 1. Proclus, in
his abstract of the Cypria (EGF p. 20), simply says that Achilles
Τρωίλον φονεύει. Apollodorus is somewhat more explicit
3. 32): μὴ θαρρούντων δὲ τῶν βαρβάρων, Ἀχιλλεὺς
Τρωίλον ἐν τῷ τοὐ Θυμβραίου Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερῷ φονεύει. He is
confirmed by schol. Τ Hom. Ω 257, who refers to Sophocles as
his authority : εντεῦθεν Σοφοκλῆς ἐν Τρωίλῳ φησὶν αὐτὸν
ὀχευθῆναι ὑπὸ Ἀχιλλέως ἵππους γυμνάζοντα παρὰ τὸ Θυμβραῖον
καὶ ἀποθανεῖν. Welcker emended ὀχευθῆναι to λογχευθῆναι on
the strength of Eustath. II. p. 1348, 23 Τρωίλον ἱππιοχάρμην,
ὅν φασὶν ἵππους ἐν τῷ Θυμβαίῳ γυμνάξοντα λόγχῃ πεσεῖν
Ἀχιλλέως. But ἐνεδρεύσας in Apollodorus rather suggests
λοχηθῆναι 2 : cf. Dio Chrys. 1 1. 77 καὶ τρωίλος τε οὕτως ἀποθνῂσκει
παῖς ὢν ἒτι καὶ Μήστωρ καὶ ἄλλοι πλείους. ἦν γὰρ ὁ Ἀχιλλεὺς
ἐνεδρεῦσαι δεινότατος καὶ νυκτὸς ἐπιθέσθαι. Although the
Trojans were already shut up in the city, it is clear that the
Thymbraeum was outside the walls (Dio Chrys. 1 1. 78). Fr. 619
shows that Sophocles agreed with the other authorities in repre-
<note type="footnote">1 Schol. A (see Lehrs, Αr. 2 190 f) contends that οἱ νεώτεροι based the story of

senting Troilus as a mere stripling: see note in loc. and add
Callim. fr. 363, where he is introduced as an illustration of ἄωρος
θάνατος. vergil's allusion Αen. I. 474 parte alia fugiens
amissis Troilus armis | infelix puer atqne impar congressus
Achilli, |fertur equis, etc.) certainly suggests that Troilus was
killed in battle, while fighting against Achilles : cf. Sen. Ag. 785.
On the other hand, in Sophocles he was surprised by Achilles
while exercising his horses, and it would seem that his sister
Polyxena had gone with him to fetch water from the spring (cf.
fr. 621). The presence of Polyxena, who escaped, is inferred from
artistic evidence alone : see Robert, Bild u. Lied, Ρ. 16, Gruppe,
p. 6721. Troilus was accompanied by an attendant whom the
Greeks regarded as the oriental counterpart of the παιδαγωγός:
see frs. 619, 620 1. The scene was somewhere in the neighbour-
hood of the temple of the Thymbraean Apollo, and Welcker
thinks that the chorus consisted of priests or country folk. It is
perhaps more likely that they were the attendants of Troilus or
Polyxena.</p>
<p>With what motive then did Achilles waylay the youthful
Troilus ? As an isolated incident of guerilla warfare, the death
of Troilus might find its place in the epics, but does not seem to
possess any dramatic value. Welcker meets the difficulty by
conjecturing that the account of Lycophron (307–313)
founded on the play of Sophocles. There Troilus is beloved by
Achilles, but infuriates him by rejecting his advances, and is
slain at the altar of Apollo 2, where he had taken refuge.
Welcker does not suggest that in Sophocles Achilles pursued
Troilus, because he was attracted by his beauty. Rather, he
killed him in a skirmish, mistaking him for a full-grown warrior;
but, when he saw the dead body, he was overcome with pity for
the beautiful boy whom he had unwittingly slain. This is more
fanciful than convincing. We can hardly draw any inference
from the appearance of the εὐνοῦχος, but it might be plausibly
argued that the love-motive was known to Sophocles from the
fact that Phrynichus ΤGF p. 723, PLG III 561) seems to have
introduced Troilus in the character of ἐρώμενος : λάμπει δ’ ἐπὶ
πορφυρέαις παρῇσι φῶς ἔρωτος. It is curious that Sophocles
himself is said to have quoted this passage, according to the
anecdote in Athen. 604 A. On the other hand, there was a legend
that Troy could not be taken, if Troilus reached the age of
twenty 3. This was referred to by Menander in his Δὶς ἐξαπατῶν,

the original of Plautus's Bacchides, where it is mentioned at
V. 954 ; and there seems to be good reason for supposing that it
was at least as old as the time of Sophocles 1. If so, he was
hardly likely to have neglected it, more especially as it provides
an excellent explanation of the ambuscade which Achilles is said
to have laid for Troilus. There is no room to speculate whether
Achilles may have been swayed by conflicting motives, his duty
to his country, and his love for Troilus ; and it is equally idle to
enquire how he was affected by the presence of Polyxena 2.</p>
<p>It should be . mentioned that Strattis wrote a comedy
entitled Troilus (I 723 K.), and that this is supposed by some
critics to have been a parody of Sophocles’ play. Meineke
suggested (Hist. crit. p. 233) that a line of Strattis, ᾖ μήποτ’, ὦ
παῖ Ζηνός, ἐς ταὐτὸν μόλῃς (schol, Ar. Vesp. 1 346), was borrowed
from Sophocles. Headlam suspected that in the line (fr. 42)
quoted by Athen. 76 E ἐρινὸν οὖν τιν’ αὐτῆς πλησίον | νεενόηκας
ὔντα; there was an allusion to the ἐρινεός οf Hom. Z 433, Λ 167.</p>
<p>Ahrens was inclined to doubt whether Achilles appeared in
the play at all, and thought that a considerable portion of it was
occupied with the lamentations for the death of Troilus, and the
description of his burial. But it is difficult to agree with a view
which robs the story of its chief dramatic motive.</p>

—άφθόγγους γάρους. ‘Τhis has never
been explained; and EUendt adopts a
conjecture ἀφθόνους, explaining it as
“unenviable.” I believe that ἀφθόγγους
refers to the shapes of animals (serpent
and lion) into which Thetis metamordesugned
phosed herself in her struggle with her
suitor Peleus. See Soph. fr. 150 (Peleus
speaks) τίς γάρ με μόχθος οὐΚ ἐπεστάτει;
λέων δράκων τε, πῦρ, ὤδωρ (Cp. Pind.
Νem. 4. 62 ff.). This reference in ἀφθόγτέκνων
γους is brought out both by παντομόρφῳ
and by συμπλακείς. The latter does not
mean simply “united with her," but
“wrestling with her" — as Peleus is 
depicted depicted on a red-figured vase in the
Berlin Museum, by Peithinos (figured
<note type="footnote">1 See Gruppe, p. 672. 2 See p. 163.</note>

in Baumeister, p. 1797). Cp. Her. 3. 78
σθμπλακέντος δὲ Γωβρύεω τῷ Μάγῳ,
"when Gobryas had grappled with him.”
Translate, then: "His was an ill-omened
bride, and bereft of speech, when he
wrestled of yore with Thetis of many
shapes." Other interpretations are :
(1) ἀφθόγγους = ἀφότους (L. and S.),
"unutterable." (2) ἀφθόγγους refers το
the sea-goddess as not speaking with
human speech, but only as gods speak :
Cp. Od. 5. 334 (Ino) ἥ πρὶν μὲν ἔην βροτὸς
αὐδήεσσα, Ι νῦν δ’ ἀλὸς ἐν πελάγεσσι

may perhaps be supported by Eur. Tro
671 καίτοι τὸ θηριῶδες ἂφθογγόν
ἒφθ, Hipp. 646 ἄφθογγα δ’ αὐταῖς

to show that the word ἄφθογγος
would readily suggest θηρία. The force οf
the epithet is then transferred, as in θνατὰ
ia-Topla ’the record of mortality’) Anth.
Pal. 7. 49, and other instances discussed
by Headlam in C.R. xvi 437 f. See also
Wecklein on Eur. Med. 1010 δόξης
εὐαγγέλου, for the freedom with which
the idiom is employed in tragedy. But
a better explanation is suggested by the
Cretan folk-lore story recorded by Bernh.
Schmidt, Volksleben der Neugriechen,
p. 116. The Nereids danced το the
music of a young peasant from Sgouro-
kephali, ’ho fell in love with one of
them. On the advice of an old woman,
he seized her by the hair, and held her
fast till cock-crow, though she changed
to a dog, a serpent; a camel, and fire.
Then she followed him home, and bore a
son to him, but never exchanged a single
word with her husband. The husband
pretended to throw the child into the
oven, when the mother cried out ’Leave
go of my child, dog!’, seized her
and vanished. The parts are reversed
here, but the coincidence with the story
of Peleus and Thetis is remarkable. The
spell which binds the Nereid to her mortal
spouse is broken by her speech. I am
indebted to Mekler for first calling my
attention to Schmidt's explanation of
ἀφθόγγους, which he has recently
and reinforced in Νeue Jahrb. f. kl. Altert.
XXVII (1911) 648 ff. It should, however,
ever, be observed that in the older story
it was the cry of Peleus that caused
Thetis to depart (fr. 151 n.), so that the
taboo must have been somewhat different.
The illustrations from Greek art which
depict the metamorphoses of Thetis are
quoted by Frazer on Pausan. 5. 18. 5

in restoring δεσπότην for δεσπότης (cr. n.),
for the words are appropriate to the
character of the παιδαγωγός, on whom
see Introductory Note. We may take it
that Troilus is referred to as ἀνδρόπαιδρ;
he is generally described as a boy: cf.
Dio Chrys. 11. 77 Τρωίλος τε οὕτως
dirodfriaKeL παῖς ὤν ἔπι, Quint. 4. 431

<p>The word ἀνδρόπαις signifies a lad on
the verge of manhood, and is synonymous
with ἀντίπαις, which it is sometimes used
to explain : see on fr. 564. Aeschylus
used it in his description of Parthenopaeus:
Theb. 520 βλάστημα
ἀνδρόπαις ἀνήp. Tzetzes (on Lycophr.
1345 ἀλκῇ νέανδρος εὐπρεπεστατος γένους)
refers to the passage in Aeschylus thus:

<p>Welcker supposed that these words

avoid the reference to Hecuba, Bergk

Agamemnon and Diomedes, is described

<p>623 Suid. s.v. ἐμασχαλίσθη· Σοφοκλῆς
ἐν Τρωίλῳ πλήρη μασχαλισμάτων
εἴρηκε τὸν μασχαλισμὸν καὶ ἐν
ἐμασκαλίσθη. The word ἐμασχαλίσθη is
omitted by Bernhardy on the authority
of three Mss. The text of Suidas is
obviously corrupt. Nauck suggests the
insertion of KaL after εἴρηκε, in which
case we should have to assume that two
fragments were cited from the Τroilus,
one as above, and the other τὸν μασχαλισμόν.
This is not very plausible ; but
it is still less likely that the words should
be reshuffled as Bernhardy proposes,
εἴρηΚε δὲ τὸν μασχαλισμὸν Σοφοκλῆς ἐν
Τρωίλῳ λέγων πλήρη μασχαλισμάτων,
though that probably gives the general
sense. Harles in Fabric. Fabric. Gr. II
p. xvi quoted from ’s papers
the following note : ‘ Electra et Troilus
citantur in Msc. Angelicae Bibliothecae,
μασχαλισθήσῃ ποτέ;’ but the clue
not appear to have been followed up.
Nauck thinks that the passage referred
to is to be found in Apostol. 11. 4
(Paroem. II 516) μασχαλισθήσῃ ποτέ...
ἀφ’ οὖ δὴ καὶ μασχαλίσματα προσηγόρευσαν
αὐτὰ (sc. τὰ μόρια) καὶ Σοφοκλῆς ἐν
Ἠλέκτρᾳ καὶ Τρωίλῳ. Rohde, Psyche,
I 4 p. 324, conjectured τὸν τράχηλον for
τὸν μασχαλισμόν, and this is perhaps
the most satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>The ancient evidence relating to μασχαλισμός
has been so fully discussed
by Jebb in his note and Appendix
on Εl. 444 f. ὐφ’ ἦς θανὼν ἄτιμος ὥστε
δυσμενὴς | ἐμασχαλίσθη, that it is unnecessary
to recapitulate it here. It may however
be remarked that the similar customs
existing among savage tribes, as collected
by Tylor, Primitive Culture 4, I p. 451 ff.,
are conclusive to show that the real
motive for the mutilation was fear of
the ghost of a slain enemy. Kaibel on
El. l.c. called attention to the strangeness
of the assertion that the severed
parts were strung together and fastened
to the arm-pits, and holds that this cannot
have been the origin of the name μασχαλισμός.
λισμός. We should rather understand
μασχαλίξειν as ‘ to cut off the arm as far
as the μασχάλη,’ with the purpose of

<pb n="259"/>
rendering the murdered man, or rather
his ghost, which would inherit his bodily
defects, powerless to execute revenge;
afterwards it was generalized so as to
apply to the other members. See also
Wilamowitz on Aesch. Cho. p. 201.
Rohde, however, argued forcibly in
favour of the explanation of Aristophanes
that the μὸΡια, known as μaσΧαAΙσμaτα,
were strung together, suspended round
the neck, carried under the arm-pits, and
fastened across the back (Psyche4, I pp.
322 — 326). The whole matter is discussed
by Kittridge in AJPVI 151. The words
ὥστε δθσμενής seem to imply that mutilation
of the dead bodies of their enemies
was an ordinary Greek custom. We
must suppose that Sophocles intended
to reproduce the manners of the heroic
age, for which he had sufficient justification
in Hom. Σ 180, X 371. Certainly
he cannot be taken to represent the
feelings of his contemporaries: such at
least is the inference to be drawn from
Hdt. 9. 79, where Pausanias repudiates
a proposal to impale the corpse of Mardonius
with the words: ‘Such things are
fitter for barbarians than for Greeks, and
odious even in them.’ To the same
effect Moschion fr. 3 (FTG p. 813) Κενὸν
θανόντος ἀνδρὸς αἰκίζειν σκιάν· | ζῶντας
κολάζειν, οὐ θανόντας εὐσεβές. Even as
a punishment for the living mutilation is
rarely mentioned in Greek literature, and
nearly always with abhorrence. The
cases of Melanthius (Hom. χ 475) and
Deiphobus (Verg. Aen. 6.496) are exceptional.
Elsewhere it is attributed to a
mythical ogre like Echetus (Hom. σ85),
to Xerxes as a punishment inflicted on
the Thracians (Aelian var. hist. 5. 11),
and threatened to the Athenians (Aristid.
I 128), to the savage Scythians (Athen.
524 Ε), to the Colchian Aeetes in his
threats against the Argonauts (Apoll.
Rhod. 3. 378), or to the inhumanity of
the tyrants (Plat. Gorg. 473 c). Of
especial significance is Aesch. Eum.
186ff. where oriental usages are referred
to. Cf. fr. 528.</p>

the elaborate adornment of the hair was
condemned as a sign of oriental τρυφή, or
of effeminacy. So should be interpreted
Hom. Λ 385 κέραι ἀγλαέ, addressed to
Paris. Cf. Verg. Aen. 12. 99 semiviri

The word has been suspected, and
Μ. Schmidt thought that the original
was αἱμάσσεται or ἀμύσσεται, and that
the gloss was added after the corruption
had taken place. What then became of
the original gloss? No inference can be
drawn from the fact that the word occurs
out of its alphabetical order, between
ἄμβασιν and ἀμβαίδην.Possibly the
Doric form (ἀμήσεται conj. Blaydes) has
stimulated the doubt; for the metaphor
was familiar enough: see on fr. 724. 4,

<p>Μ. Schmidt conjectured that the words

been applied to a bow-case. πέσκος
was derived by metathesis from σκέπω

For ἀπιστεῖν see on fr. 32. Nauck prefers
to write ἄπειστος· ἀπαράπειστος with
Bernardus, rightly as regards the gloss.
But there is no evidence to support the
spelling ἄπειστος, and it is fanciful to
insist on the distinction. In Aesch.
Τheb. 861, where the verbal force is
strongly marked, φίλων ἄπειστοι is given
by most modern texts ; and εὔπειστα is
well-supported in Ai. 151. Tucker on

Hesych. explains that ἰήιος was an epithet
of Apollo : cf. Ο.Τ. 154, 1096. But it
is also an epithet of βοή etc. when used
for a cry of lamentation. So Eur. Phoen.

Hesych. in p. 88 μέλλει· φαίνεται,
δοκεῖ· ἢ μένει.</p>
<p>These are puzzling statements, but we
should hardly reject them as incredible.
The intention is to quote from Sophocles
an instance of ixiXKei with a sense entirely
different from that in the repbublic, and
capable of being represented by μένει.
Now, in the sense of delaying or holding
back μέλλω and μένω almost coincide, as
may be seen e.g. in Hom. I 318 ἴση
μένοντι, καὶ εἰ μάλα τις πολεμίζοι. We
might therefore guess that the passage in
the Troilus was parallel to Phil. 1256
ἀλλὰ κἀμέ τοι | ταὐτὸν τόδ’ ὄψῃ δρῶντα
κοὐ μἐλλοντ’ ἔτι, or El. 318 ἥξοντος ἢ
μέλλοντος; The objection would be that
the regular gloss for μέλλω in this sense
is βραδύνω: see schol. L on ll. cc., and
Phot., Suid., Etym. M. etc. However,
schol. rec. on Aesch. Prom. 654 gives
ἀναβάλλῃ in explanation οf μέλλεις, and
the choice of μένει here may have been
influenced by the particular context.</p>

οἳ δὲ σκώληκα, παρ’ ὅσον δερμιστὴς οὖτος.
βέλτιον δὲ τὸν χαλκοῦν ἔχοντα δέρμα
νοεῖν.... At this point Palmerius introduced
words which are misplaced in the
MS of Hesychius : ὡσεὶ ἔλεγε χαλκοδερμιστής·
τὰ γὰρ σάκκη ἐπίχαλκα λέγει
(λέλεται conj. Μ. Schmidt).</p>
<p>See on fr. 449. It will be observed
that the note in Photius supports the
view there taken, that Aristarchus and
Didymus interpreted δερμηστής correctly.
There can be no doubt that Μ. Schmidt
was right (Didym. p. 21) in identifying
δερμηστής and σα[κ]κοδερμηστής, although
Stephanus, whom L. and S. follow, held
that they were entirely distinct. Schmidt
interprets the word, on the analogy of
σακκοπήρα, as ‘qui hirtum pellem comedit’;
but I prefer the form with
σακο-, understanding ‘devouring the hide
of the shield’ (cf. δέρμα κελαινόν in Z 117).
The activity of the grub would be appropriate
to the sentiment which has
been illustrated in connexion with fr. 286.</p>
<p>The tradition of the note in Hesychius
has suffered confusion : I suggest that we
should read &#x003C;οἳ μὲν&#x003E; ὄδιν σάκος ἐσθίοντα.
This would bring it into agreement with
Photius, and relieve Aristarchus from any
suspicion of having supported the view
that is recommended in the latter part of
the note : Fritzsche and Reitzenstein (fr.
449 n.) even thought that Aristarchus
supposed Soph, to refer to a serpent
painted on a shield (reading ἔχον).
Schmidt says : ‘Didymus aperte Aristarchi
interpretationem amplexus est. nam
quod Aristarchus σάκος dixerat, χαλκοῦν
δέρμα esse monstrat.’ This
me open to serious question, and to be
inconsistent with the testimony of Photius.
I take the view introduced by ἄμεινον
(βέλτιον) to be due to some
who was puzzled by the word,
and had forgotten the early prevalence
of leather shields. See now B. Keil in
Herm. XLViii 103.</p>
<p>ΤΥΜΠΑΝΙΣΤΑΙ</p>
<p>Nauck says, ‘de argumento non constat.’ Most critics,
however, have accepted Welcker's inference that the Τυμπανισταί
was concerned with the legend οf Phineus, even if they have not
gone so far as he did in identifying it with one of the two plays
named after him. Fr. 645 proves that the second marriage of
Phineus was mentioned by Sophocles in this play, although of
course this might have been an incidental allusion, like that in
the Antigone (966 ff.). But it is remarkable that of the other eight
fragments remaining two clearly relate to the ancestry of
Phineus (637, 643), and that one of these, which contains a pronoun
of the first person plural, mentions the Sarpedonian cave,
to which Orithyia was carried by Boreas. It seems unlikely
that these facts are to be attributed entirely to accident.
Possibly Cleopatra was the speaker of fr. 637 1, but there is
<note type="footnote">1 Or, as Hiller v. Gaertringen (p. 59) prefers, the pronoun may refer to the sons of
Orithyia.</note>

nothing else in the fragments which gives any clue to the
probable action of the play. For the various possibilities see

were small drums, in the form of (i) a tambourine, or (2) a kettledrum.
They were covered with hides (Eur. (Eur. 1347 τύπανα...
Βυρσοτευῆ), and were beaten with the hand. Because the beating
of timbrels is occasionally spoken of with a certain degree of
contempt (Ar. Lys. 388, Dem. 18. 284), it does not follow that
Boeckh (Tr. Gr. princ. p. 129) and Hermann (de Aesch. Niobe,
p. 4) were justified in concluding that this was a satyr-play. But,
if the Thracian Salmydessus was the scene of the play, a chorus of
Bacchic devotees would not be out of place. For the connexion
of Dionysus with Thrace see the evidence collected by Kern in
Pauly-Wissowa V loii f, and cf. Hdt 5. 7, Eur. Hec. 1267. The
title is clearly suggestive of foreign ritual : cf. Apul. de deo Socr.

but it is extremely difficult to estimate
exactly the subtlety of intention which
may have been present to various writers
at different times. Each case must be

These peoples are grouped together

Originally Chaldaea was the name of a

in Hermes XLii 212 remarks that this is
the earliest example of Σύρος in place of
Σύριος. He holds that the shortened form
arose from the compound Λευκόσυρος (cf.

ἄδημος, which is not recorded elsewhere,

ἀπόδημος. For similar doublets see on
fr. 558. If ἄδημος expressed nothing more
than a temporary absence from home,
analogy does not support the usage. We
should rather expect it to be applied to an

Kock (I 806) assigns this to the
Τυμπανισταί (or Τυμπανίστριαι) of Αutocrates,
and there is nothing to determine
whether he is right as against those who
have claimed it for Sophocles. ’s
only ground for making the attribution
is that, inasmuch as the title
Τυμπανίστριαι is more appropriate than
Τυμπανισταί to the fragment (fr. 1 )
by Ael. nat. an. 12. 9, it is likely to be
the true title of ’ play. In the
fragment referred to (fr. 1, 3 f.), where
it is clear that something has fallen out,
H. would read κοῦφα πηδῶσαι &#x003C;ποδοῖν
κἀνασείουσαι&#x003E; κίμαν, quoting Ar.
1308 — 18 Eur. Bacch. 240. ἤ has
been corrected to ἐν (Musurus) : but this
would introduce an unusual formula of
quotation, and it is obvious that the
whole gloss is corrupt. I infer from
Η.’s notes that he thought the original
was something like &#x003C;ἐστὶ&#x003E;
&#x003C;ἐστὶ καὶ&#x003E; νομίζεται ἤ λέγεται ὅπερ
ἔστι, i.e. ‘ is thought or called what it

He finds the earliest occurrence

<p>641 Ηesych. I p. 197 ἀνετῶς· ἀνατεταλμένως.
Σοφοκλῆς Τυμπανισταῖς.
Phavorinus corrected the explanation to
ἀνατεταμένως, and so the gloss is printed
by the editors of Hesych. and Soph.,
regardless of the fact that ἀνετῶς ought
το mean exactly the opposite of ἀννατεταμένως.
Tucker (C. R. XVIII 431) proposed
ἀτενῶς, and the same correction
was made independently by Housman
(C. Q. IV 117). I should prefer to read
ἀναπεπταμένως in the sense of ‘openly,
frankly,’ for ἀναπετάννυμι is a
word in scholiastic Greek. There is no
other certain instance of the word ἀνετῶς
(or perhaps rather ἀνέτως, as Housman,
and before him Lobeck, Paralip. p. 481,
preferred) ; but Lobeck (Phryn. p. 70)
was probably right in restoring it in
Hesych. I p. 313 ἀτετῶς· ἀφροντίστως.
In the new papyrus of the Aefia of
Callimachus (Ox. Pap. p. 26) at
V. 39 the MS seems to have ἥ δ’ ἀνετῶς
τᾶν ἐκάλυψεν ἐπος, but this is obviously
impossible and has been variously
emended : see the remarks of Piatt (C. Q.

<p>642 Hesych. Ι Ρ. 215 ἀντιστρέφω·
ἀνταξιῶ. Σοφοκλῆς Τυμπανισταῖς.
The only recorded meaning οf ἀνταξιῶ
is ’to require an ’ which does
not suit ἀντιστρέφω. The usage of
simple verb might justify us in supposing
that it also meant ’to make (or deem) equinalent’;
and in that sense it might have
been used to explain ἀντιστρέφω (λόγον)
‘to retort.’ since ἀνταξιῶ could hardly
intransitive. But I believe the true reading
is ἀντιξοῶ, and that Soph, used ἀντιστρέξειν
for ‘to be opposed to’ or ‘to
correspond to.’ Τhe idea that ἀντίξοος
was solely Ionic and poetical is probably
incorrect. It was a technical trade term
with carpenters and masons ; and there
is plenty of evidence of its survival in
Hellenistic and Byzantine times.</p>

<p>The first explanation of this obscure
word refers to the story of Erichthonius,
whom Athena was said to have enclosed
in a chest immediately after his birth,
and to have entrusted to the guardianship
of the three daughters of Cecrops. She
charged them strictly that they should on
no account open the chest. Nevertheless,
impelled by curiosity, one or more of the
three sisters, Aglauros, Pandrosos, and
Herse, examined the box, and saw the
child with one or two (according το others)
serpents coiled around him. According
to one account, the offenders were killed
by the serpent; but others said that they
were visited with frenzy in consequence
of their disobedience to the goddess, and
threw themselves down the rock of the
Acropolis. The chief authorities are
Eur. Ion 21 ff., 271 ff. ; Ov. Met. 2.
552 ff. Apollod. 3. 189. The second
explanation mentions the association of
his daughters with Cecrops, for whom

<pb n="267"/>
cf. Ar. Vesp. 438 ὦ Κέκροψ ἥρως ἄναξ,
τὸ πρὸς ποδῶν Δρακοντίδη. According to
the third view, one of the sisters served
the goddess as attendant on her sacred
serpent which Hved on the Acropolis :
for the οἰκουρὸς ὄφις see Hdt. 8. 41
Lys. 758. Frazer (on Pausan. 1. 18. 2)
holds that Erichthonius was originally a
personification of this serpent.</p>
<p>From the above evidence modern
authorities (Jessen in Pauly-Wissowa v
1646, Gruppe Gr. Myth. p. 808) draw
the inference that δράκαυλος was a title
of Athena. The more natural conclusion
is that it was employed as an epithet of
the daughters of Cecrops or of one of
them. But the word itself, which does
not recur, is mysterious. It was interpreted
as δρακοντ-αυλος, and Lobeck
(Paral. p. 48, Phryn. p. 669) compares
it with λεόπαρδος, γυναιμανής, Ἀτλαυενής,
and the like. See also the examples of
metaplasm in -n- stems given by Brug-
mann, Comp. Gr, li p. 27 E. tr. But
the compound ‘ snake-dwelling ’ can with
difficulty be forced to bear the meaning
’ living with a snake’ ; and we may suspect
that the traditional explanations
have grown out of the popular derivation
of an obsolete word. Crusius, however,
suggests (in Roscher i 1200) that the
second part of the compound is to be
explained by the association of sacred
serpents with particular caves or hollows,
and refers to Asclepius Aulonius (Pausan.
4. 36.7), and Aulis, the name of one of
the Praxidicae (Suid. s.v.). δράκαυλος
would then be an epithet of the guardian
snake itself. It is worth notice that an
allusion to Erichthonius would be natural
in the Tympanistae, if the fortunes of
Phineus were its subject ; for Orithyia,
the mother of Cleopatra, was the daughter
of Erechtheus (Ant. 981 f.).</p>

<p>This passage is so important that it
requires to be set out at length ; but it is
impossible to determine on the evidence
which it affords taken by itself how much
of the story and which version of it were
included in the Tympanistae. For the
difficult questions involved see Intro-
ductory Note to the Phineus (p. 313).
Here it is enough to point out that the
scholiast refers to three different versions
of the blinding of the Phineidae, according
to which the agent in the savage deed
was either (i) the stepmother Idaea (or
Idothea), (2) Phineus, or (3) Cleopatra.
The first two are repeated in schol. Ap.
Rhod. I. 211. According to schol.
Apoll. Rhod. 2. 178 (fr. 704) Sophocles
adopted (2). But in the Antigone (973 —
978) he clearly follows (I), not only in
describing the outrage as inflicted by the
stepmother, but also in referring to the
imprisonment of the sons. Moreover, if
Jebb is right in inferring that the fate of
Cleopatra was the subject of the comparison
made in the Antigone, the poet
has there in part introduced the version
of (3) ; for according to (i) and (2) [μετὰ
δὲ τὸν KXeoirdrpas θάνατον] Cleopatra
was already dead.</p>
<p>The schol. appears to say that Idothea
was the name of the stepmother in the
Tympanistae ; but, as there is definite
evidence that Sophocles elsewhere if not
here called her Idaea (see on fr. 704),
G. ’s suggestion that ἦς goes back
to Ἰδαίαν has met with some favour.</p>

<pb n="268"/>
<p>Until quite recently only a single quotation (fr. 646) was
referred to the title Tyndareus. Welcker accordingly conjectured
(p. 216) that Tyndareus was a character in the Aletes, to which
play the lines should be attributed. Ribbeck (p. 268) took a
similar view, but preferred to assign the fragment to the
Hermione; and Bernhardy (Gr. Litt. 3 II. 2 Ρ. 334) thought that
the lines bore the stamp of a later period and should be regarded
as the work of the younger Sophocles. Now that a second
quotation has come to light in the newly-discovered Photius
(fr. 647), the probability of error is proportionately diminished.
Wilamowitz 1, however, still thinks that Bernhardy's judgment of
fr. 646 was correct, and Hense suggests that the real Tyndareus
fragment and the lemma to which the words quoted belong have
been lost from the text of Stobaeus.</p>
<p>Tyndareus is not a character whose own fortunes are likely
to have been made the subject of a play ; for there is nothing
dramatic in the story of his banishment, as related by Pausan. 3.
I. 4, and ApoUod. 3. 124 f. He rather became notorious owing
to the evil deeds of his daughters : Eur. Or. 540 ἐγὼ δὲ τἄλλα
μακάριος πέφυκ’ ἀνήρ, | πλὴν ἐς θυγατέρας· τοῦτο δ’ οὐΚ
This passage suggests that fr. 646 refers to a time when
the prosperity of Tyndareus was impaired in consequence of the
sorrows of his descendants, and the allusion to old age in fr. 647
points in the same direction. One legend made him the
accuser of Orestes in his trial at Athens (Apollod. epit. 6. 25)1</p>
<p>Tyndareus was the title of a tragedy by Nicomachus, for
whom see Haigh, Tragic Drama, p. 469.</p>

Schmidt justly remarks, does not defend
the text. The same critic argues in
favour of the adoption of κὠλίγῳ πόνῳ,
quoting Ο. C. 1341 βραχεῖ σὺν ὂγκῳ καὶ
χρόνῳ (where πόνῳ has some MS support),
and ῥᾳδίως καὶ ταχύ and similar combinations
in late authors. Perhaps however
we might read κἀλόγῳ ’incalculable’: the
word was used by Soph. (fr. 262), and
for the sense I would compare Thuc. ὁ.
46, where the comparative is to be explained
according to the n. On Eur.
Hclid. 110, ’incalculable rather than not.’

5 f. Exception has been taken to two
points in these lines : (1) δόσις is altered
to μένος by F. W. Schmidt, and to φθόνος
by Herzer (τίσις conj. Blaydes) ; (2) Nauck
(Index, p. XIII) thought that v. 6 did not
cohere with the preceding words, and
that it must have been wrongly attached
to the present fragment. Taking the
latter criticism first, I understand ΚαΚὸς
δαίμων as the subject of μεταστῇ, applied
here, as in Plat. rep. 553 E, to that which
comes into being as the result of change.
The form of expression is familiar to
tragedy : cf. Aesch. Pers. 161 εἴ τι μὴ
δαίμων παλαιὸς νῦν μεθέστηκε στρατῷ,
ib. 944 δαίμων γὰρ ὃδ᾿ αὖ | μετάτροπος
ἐπ’ ἐμοί (where Paley rightly explains
αὖ), Theb. 693 ἐπεὶ δαίμων | λήματος αὖ
τροπαίᾳ χρονίᾳ μεταλ- | λακτὸς ἲσως ἂν
ἒλθοι, Eur. Alc 912 μεταπίπτοντος δαίμνος,
Tro 102 μεταβαλλομένου δαίμονος,
It is not always easy to seize the exact
force of δαίμων, which was rapidly
moving towards the impersonal sense :
see on fr. 653. But δαίμνος κατοῦ
δόσις here is not merely ‘ the dispensation
of a cruel fate.’ In these words we can
hardly fail to see the expression of a
belief in the subjection of the control
of a mysterious and destructive power,
which is sometimes imagined as permeating
its victim (cf. κακοδαιμονᾶν: so
I should incline το explain Ai. 1214
ἀνεῖται στυγερῷ δαίμονι), but more often
as assailing him from without (Ο. Τ. 1301
τίς ὁ πηδήσας | μείζονα δαίμων τῶν μακίστων
| πρὸς σῇ δυσδαίμονι μοίρᾳ ; Pers.
356 ἦρξεν μέν, ὦ δέσποινα, τοῦ παντὸς
κακοῦ | φανεὶς ἀλάστωρ ἢ κακὸς δαίμων
ποθέν). I will only add that the wellknown
line of Menander (fr. 550, 111
167 K. ἂπαντι δαίμων ἀνδρὶ συμπαρίσταται|
εὐθὺς γενομένῳ) does not imply that
every one is always guided by an unchangeable
δαίμων. The influences to
which we are exposed are various, and
even if El. 916 τοῖς αὐτοῖσί τοι | οὐχ
αὑτὸς ἀεὶ δαιμόνων παραστατεῖ is not to
be taken in the fullest sense (see Kaibel's
n.), it points to the existence of a popular
belief to that effect. The Stoics took
account of current opinion, when they
incorporated this doctrine in their system :
cf. Plut. qu. Rom. 51 p. 277 A καθάπερ
οἱ περὶ Χρύσιππον οἴονται Φιλόσφοι φαῦλα

<pb n="270"/>
χρῶνται καὶ κολασταῖς ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀνοσίους
καί ἀδίκους ἀνθρώπους. If these considerations
are recognized, there is the less
difficulty in δόσις (see O. T. 1518, fr. 964,
Aesch. Pers. 1042); for if any doubt is 
felt as to the agency imputed to it, it will
bedispelled by a reference to Eur. Hipp.
1433 f. (quoted on fr. 665), and that the
gifts of the ‘gods’ may be evil is constantly 
laid down (Headlam, On editing

Ἀχαιαί, who belonged to an earlier generation. In λ 235
world, whose spirits he questioned, as they came to drink the 
blood from the trench. Tyro was the daughter of Salmoneus
and the wife of Cretheus his brother. Being enamoured of the 
Thessalian1 river-god Enipeus, she used to pay frequent visits
to the bank of the stream. Here Poseidon wooed her in the 
likeness of Enipeus, and begat by her Pelias and Neleus, who
both became mighty chieftains, Pelias in Iolcus, and Neleus in
Pylos. And to Cretheus Tyro bore Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon. 
Lucian (dial. mar. 13) uses the Homeric account without
adding anything to it; but it scarcely contains the elements of 
a dramatic story. According to Apollod. I. 90—92, Tyro, the
daughter of Salmoneus and Alcidice, while she was being
brought uup in the house of Cretheus, her paternal uncle, became
enamoured of Enipeus. The sequel fell out as in Homer; but,
when Tyro's twins were born, she concealed the birth, and exposed
them. A herd of orses passed by, and a mare trod on
one of the infants, leaving a livid mark on its face. The herdsman 
reared the children, giving to the injured child the name 
Pelias (from πελιδνός), and to the other that of Neleus. When
<note type="footnote">1 There is nothing in Homer connecting Tyro with the Elean Enipeus: for the
other view see Strabo 356. The Thessalian Enipeus is specified in Prop. 1. 13. 21,
3. 19. 13.</note>

<pb n="271"/>
they grew up, they discovered their mother, and put to death
her stepmother Sidero, by whom Tyro had been ill-treated.
Sidero had escaped from them to the sanctuary of Hera, but
Pelias, who subsequently continued to slight the power of the
goddess, cut her down at the altar. The scene is still Thessaly,
as is proved by the constant connexion of Cretheus with Iolcus1.
Diodorus (4. 68), who eliminates all the romantic details, locates
the intrigue with Poseidon in Elis at a time subsequent to the
death of Salmoneus, and makes the marriage with Cretheus
later still. Schol. Hom. K 334 and Eustathius (Od. p. 168 1, 52)
add to the story of Pelias' disfigurement that the other child
suckled by a bitch who had lost her puppies. Aelian (v.h. 12. 45)
says that Pelias was reared by a mare. The circumstances of
the ’s exposure and their subsequent recognition recall
the legend of Romulus and Remus; and Trieber (RA. Mus. XLIII
569 ff.) held that Sophocles was the ultimate source from which
Diodes of Peparethos derived the details of the Roman myth 2.</p>
<p>From this rather scanty material 3 we are left to deduce the
plot of Sophocles with such assistance as is provided by certain
external evidence relating to the play. From schol. Eur. Or. 1691
we learn that the recognition took place in the concluding scene
(κατὰ τὸ τέλος). Further, Aristotle (poet. 16. 16. 25)
that it was effected by means of the cradle in which the babies
were exposed. This incident was the subject of a jesting allusion
in the Lysistrata of Aristophanes (fr. 657). The result of ’s
ill-treatment by Sidero was made visible to the spectators by the
actor's mask : Pollux 4. 141 (among the examples of τὰ ἔκσκευα
πρόσωτα) Τυρὼ πελιδνὴ τὰς παρειὰς παρὰ Σοφοκλεῖ... τοῦτο δ’
ὑπὸ τῆς μητρυιᾶς Σιδηροῦης πληγαῖς 4 πέπονθεν. Her disfigure-
ment contrasted markedly with the cream-white complexion,
which had earned for her the name of Tyro: see on fr. 648.
Similarly the effect of fr. 659 is much more striking when we
recall that her hair was one of the chief ornaments of ’s
beauty. Hom. β 119, referred to above, may be merely formal,
but such is hardly the case with Pind. Pyth. 4. 1 36 υροῦς ἑρασιπλοκάμου.</p>
<p>We cannot suppose that the tragedies of Astydamas (Suid.)
and Carcinus ΤGF p. 799) had much effect upon the tradition,
<note type="footnote">1 ApoUod. I. 96, 107. The version of ApoUodorus is clearly an unsuccessful
conflation of two different stories. τρεφομένη παρὰ Κρηθεῖ is an attempt to reconcile
the tradition that Tyro was wife of Cretheus with the essential requirement of the
story that she was persecuted by her stepmother.

and, in view of the dearth of literary evidence, Welcker not
unreasonably illustrated Sophocles by the help of a Cyzicene
epigram: Α. Ρ. 3. 9 ἐν τῷ Θ Πελίας καὶ Νηλεὺς
οἱ Ποσειδῶνος παῖδες, ἐκ δεσμῶν τὴν ἑαυτῶν μητέρα ῥυόμενοι,
πρώην ὁ πατὴρ μὲν Σαλμωνεὺς διὰ τὴν φθοβὰν ἔδησεν· ἡ δὲ
αὐτῆς Σιδηρὼ τὰς βασάνους αὐτῇ ἐπέτεινεν.—
<lg>
<l>μὴ Τυρὼ τρύχοι σὸν ἔτι σπείρημα,</l>

<l>οὐκέτι γὰρ δουλώσει ἐν ἕρκεσιν, ἐγγύθιλεύσσων</l> 
<l>Νηλέα καὶ Πελίαν τούσδε καθεζομένους 1.</l>
</lg>
Εngelmann 2, however, repudiated the relevance to Sophocles of
this epigram ; and relied on archaeological evidence to prove that
the recognition by Tyro of her sons took place near a fountain
to which she had been sent to fetch water. Even if he is wrong,
’s explanation of fr. 660 as referring to ’s prison-
house is highly improbable. It is much more likely that it
describes an ill-omened incident 3, which interrupted the progress
of a festal banquet. Possibly the same feast is referred to in
fr. 666, from which Welcker inferred that Salmoneus entertained
the two sons on their arrival.</p>
<p>New evidence has recently come to light, which bears on the
circumstances of the recognition ; for we can hardly doubt that
Menand. Epitr. 108 — 116 refers to the Tyro of Sophocles:
<lg>
<l>τεθέασαι τραγῳδούς, οἶδ’ ὄτι,</l>
<l>καὶ ταῦτα κατέχεις πάντα. Νηλέα</l>
<l>Πελίαν τ’ ἐκείνους εὖρε πρεσβύτης ἀνὴρ</l>
<l>αἰπόλος, ἔχων οἴαν ἐγὼ νῦν διφθέραν·</l>
<l>ὡς δ᾿ ᾒσθετ’ αὐτοὺς ὄντας αὑτοῦ</l>
<l>λέγει τὸ πρᾶγμ’, ὡς εὗρεν, ὡς</l>
<l>ἔδωκε δ’ αὐτοῖς πηρίδιον γνωρισμάτων,</l>
<l>ἐξ οὐ μαθόντες πάντα τὰ καθ’ αὑτοὺς σαξῶς</l>
<l>ἐγένοντο βασιλεῖς οἱ τότ’ ὄντες αἰπόλοι.</l>
</lg>
Here there are two facts which appear to be at variance with the
rest of our information : (1) αἰπόλος contradicts Apollodorus, and
appears to exclude the etymological explanation of the name
Pelias. In this respect we may well prefer Menander to Apollo-
dorus, for there is nothing to show that the latter drew upon a
tragic source. (2) πηρίδιον γνωρισμάτων seems to exclude recognition
by means of the σκάφη. The statements previously
quoted concerning the σκάφη are such as we cannot reject; but
it is not necessarily inconsistent with them to suppose that the
<note type="footnote">1 Stadtmueler's text. Wilamowitz (ap. Engelmann, p. 50 n.) proposed λεύσσω
in V. 3.
2 Arch. Studien, p. 40 ff.
3 So also Engelmann, p. 46, and Hartung, p. 74.</note>

<pb n="273"/>
foster-father of the youths, when parting with them, gave them
the crepimdia which he had found in the σκάφη for the purpose
of estabHshing their rank. Observe that the change of condition
is ’s point, and the σκάφη might well have appeared an
inadequate token of their origin.</p>
<p>Engelmann seems to be justified in inferring from Aristophanes
that Poseidon appeared at the end of the play as θεὸς ἀπὸ μηχανῆς.
His appearance was necessary to the complete vindication of
Τγrο ; for we must suppose that Salmoneus had acquiesced in
the cruelty of Sidero in consequence of the disgrace which had
befallen his daughter 1. Further, Engelmann is certainly right
in maintaining that Salmoneus was still alive, though frs. 664
and 665 might be otherwise explained than with reference to
the discovery of his error. But the power of a stepmother over
the children of her ’s former wife ceases of necessity
when their father dies. For similar reasons we ought to con-
clude that Tyro was not already the wife of Cretheus, when
she was seduced by Poseidon. Here at least we may follow
Diodorus, with whom Sophocles probably also agreed in making
Elis the scene of the action 2. The confused narrative of Apollodorus
seems to have been influenced by a desire to adhere to the
Thessalian Enipeus, although he did not venture to assert that
Salmoneus and Sidero were living in Thessaly. The marriage
with Cretheus must therefore have been subsequent to the re-
habilitation of Tyro, and Engelmann plausibly suggests that
Poseidon ordered Salmoneus to betroth his daughter to his
younger brother.</p>
<p>So far we have attempted to form some notion of the scope
and progress of the play composed on the theme of the sorrows
which befell Tyro as the result of her union with Poseidon. We
should expect it to contain an exposition of ’s unhappiness
and ’s cruelty, the arrival of the young men, their meeting
with Salmoneus, their recognition of their mother, the punishment
of Sidero, and the final appearance of Poseidon. But there is
conclusive evidence that Sophocles wrote two plays bearing this
title. What then was the subject of the second play? Welcker
had no hesitation in holding that it was nothing but a revised
edition of the first, and Dindorf agreed with him. Engelmann
has recently revived a suggestion formerly made by Hartung 3
that the subject of the second Tyro is to be found in Hygin.
fab. 60 (cf ib. 239, 254), which has already been abstracted in
the Introductory Note to the Sisyphus, and, in order to fill the
lacuna in the text, he supposes that Sisyphus avenged himself
<note type="footnote">1 See Α. Ρ. 3. 9. (supra) 2 Cf. fr. 649. 3 p. 77.
P. II. 18</note>

<pb n="274"/>
by persuading Salmoneus to imitate Zeus. Another possibility
is that the tragedy comprised the earlier history of Tyro, and
the circumstances of her betrayal. In that case fr. 653 would
be appropriate to the concealment of ’s lot, echoing the
command of Poseidon in X 251 νῦν δ’ ἔρχευ πρὸς δῶμα· καὶ
ἴσχεο μηδ’ ὀνομήνῃς. Neither Welcker's explanation that
words were spoken by one of the sons in the recognition-scene,
nor ’s that Salmoneus asked that his mistake should
not be published, seems to be entirely satisfactory. But on the
general question ’s verdict is hardly to be gainsaid :
‘ differentiam (fabularum) rimari nunc non ’</p>
<p>Ribbeck 1 thinks that the anonymous Nelei carmen was
largely concerned with this subject.</p>

an error for ἐν JlTjXei. But a detail is

is likely that Tyro is referred to in the
fragment ; and ἐν Πλίᾳ presumably means
ἐν Τυριῖ (α' or β'). for in that tragedy
iron-hearted stepmother, Sidero, was
put to death by Pelias.’ (H.) Add

the wrappings of a mummy were pub-
lished by Grenfell and Hunt in Hibeh
Papyri, 1 p. 17, and dated approximately
at B.C. 280—240. Blass ascribed the
fragments to the Tyro of Sophocles on
the following grounds : (i) The mention
of the Alpheus in v. 39 agrees with the
fact that Elis was the adopted country
of Salmoneus, father of Tyro. Cf. Eur.
fr. 14 ὅσ τ’ ἐπ’ Ἀλφειοῦ ῥοαῖς Ι δεοῦ μανεὶς
ἔρριψε Σαλμωνεὺς φλόγα. See also
Introd. Note at p. 273. (2) The horrible
dream referred to in v. v. (cf. v. 9) fits
certain extant fragments of the Tyro
(especially frs. 660, 661); but this is a
very lame argument, as may be seen by
a reference to the passages in question.
(3) The prayer in v. 52 f., addressed to
Poseidon, is entirely appropriate to the
sons of Tyro. If it were possible to
read the word before ἀρωγόν as
as Blass suggested, this argument would
be decisive ; but the editors state that the
letters as are very doubtful, and that there

certainty. The first step was taken by
Soping, who saw that νῦσος required

by Dindorf (in Thesaur. iv 2750), who
introduced θεία as the necessary consequence.
Nauck, admitting that θεανή

due to dittography, after νόσος had become
νῆσος; for few will incline to M.

Schmidt's θεία ἀνῇ νόσος. It should be
mentioned that the lemma comes between
θέαμα and deavQarai, so that the corruption
was antecedent to the present alphabetical
order, θεία in the gloss is probably
derived from a correction of the corrupt
lemma, just as ῥοιτοῦ represents letters
suprascript to υροι: the name of the
play was restored by Musurus.
The use of θεῖος= ‘heaven-sent’ is
more frequent in Soph, than in the other
tragedians, and θεία νόσος occurs in Αi.

clearly parallel to Menander fr. 605 (III

’πίδηλον τὴν τύχην πολλοῖς ποιῇς. F. W.
Schmidt (see cr. n.) is over-subtle in
objecting to the dative, which is as much
in place to express the interest of the
hearers as εἶ c. ace. elsewhere to define
the area of extension. — Observe how
completely δαίμων has sunk to the level
of τύχη, and cf. Eur. Alc. 561 πῶς οὖν

likely therefore that the editors make
too much of El. 1306 οὐ γὰρ ἄν καλῶς |
ὑπηρετοίην τῷ παρόντι δαίμονι, which
simply expresses ‘ to use my present
’ This use of δαίμων is said to
be characteristic of the drama and especially
of Sophocles ; for, although not unknown
in lyric, it is very rare (Find.
Isihm. 7. 42 Θνᾴσκομεν γὰρ ὁμῶς ἄπαντες·
δαίμων δ’ ἄϊσος). Βut the notion that the
sense of ‘ apportioner ’ ‘ God ’ is secondary,
and that δαίμων originally signified fortune
is altogether perverse (Gruppe, p. 9914).

<p>H. writes : ‘ It was one of the cardinal
Greek maxims, not to publish your misfortunes
lest your enemies should have
you in derision. Such is the saying
attributed by Demetrius Phalereus in
Sioh. flor. 3. 79 (Diels, Vorsokr. 3 II p. 217
21) to Periander: δυστυχῶν κρύπτε,
μὴ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς εὐφράνῃς. [See frs.
83 (nn.).] The same idea is implied by
the fear of affording ground of exultation
to enemies (Hom. Γ 51, Z 82, K 192
ψ 342, Aesch. Αg. 1270). Most of the
passages to this effect are quoted by
Stobaeus flor. 109; I may add a fragment
of Archilochus (fr. 10, in schol. Aesch,
Prom. 643 as emended) κρύπτωμεν δ’
ἀνιηρὰ Ποσειδάωνος ἄνακτος | δῶρα, Hom.
σ 142 τῷ μὴ τίς ποτε πάμπαν ἀνὴρ ἀθεμίστιος
εἴη, | ἀλλ’ ὅ γε σιγῇ δῶρα θεῶν ἔχοι

(fr. I, Nauck, p. 824) τίς δ’ ἔστ’ ἀνάγκη
δυστυχεῖν ἐν πλείοσιν, | ἐξὸν σιωπᾶν κἀν
σκότῳ κρύπτειν τόδε ; and a tragic fragment
(Nauck, p. 936) which appears to
be an expression of the same idea : Stob.
ecl. I. 3. 43 p. 60, 7 W. ὅστις λέγει κακὰν
φρονῶν σιγῇ στένει. The subject of that
chapter is the certain retribution of God's
Justice, and the anthologist must somehow
or other have been deceived by a
false reading, when he included a line
which is entirely irrelevant to his purpose.
The true sense was restored by
F. W. Schmidt : ὅστις γ’ ἔχει κάκ’, εὖ
φρονῶν σιγῇ στέγει : and στέγει may be
right ; but we see from this fragment of
Sophocles that it is not necessary. I
would rather read, ὅστις δ’ ἔχει κάκ’, εὖ
φρονῶν σιγῇ στένει, — “Βut he that suffers, |
It he be wise, laments in secrecy.”’

<p>τίς ὄρνις ὄρνις οὔτος ἔξεδρον χώραν ἔχων;</p>
<p>654 Schol. Ar. ν. 275 (νὴ
ἔτερος δῆτα χοὗτος ἔξεδρον χώραν
ἐκ τῆς Σοφοκλέους δευτέρας Τυροῦς ἀρχή
(ἐκ τοῦ Σοφοκλέους
ὡς εἰ εἶπε χροιάν. ἔξεδρον δὲ παρηλλαγμένην.
Σοφοκλῆς ‘οὐκ ἔξεδρος ἀλλ’ ἔντοπος
ἁνήρ’ (Phil. 211). The note has
been quoted in full, because the commentators
mentators are not agreed as to the point
of the parody. It is clear that a double
meaning ἔξεδρος is involved, and I think
that for Aristophanes the schol. is right in
interpreting παρηλλαγμένην, i.e. strange,
abnormal (Holden on Plut. Them. 24, 2).
For this sense of ἔξεδρος cf. Arist. rhel.
3. 3. 1406 a 35 οὕτως ἔξεδρον τὴν
μοχθηρίας ὑπερβολήν. Ar. means: ‘Ηere's
another odd-looking customer ! ’ Rogers,
rendering ‘ with a foreign aspect,’
in his note that the proper meaning is
‘ belonging to a foreign land.’
Suidas, who, as is well known, borrows
from the Aristophanic scholia, has the
gloss in this form : ἔξεεδρος· ἔξεδρον χρόαν
ἔχων. τουτέστι παρηλλαγμέην. I believe
that Ar. actually wrote χρόαν and that
has been corrupted in our texts to χώραν:
the knowledge that ἔξεδρον χώραν was in
fact parodied of course assisted the Corruption.
[Blaydes also favoured this
view, and Hall and Geldart, I find, have
printed χρόαν.] This makes everything
plain sailing, except the obscurity of
ἀρχή. ’Welcker (p. 316) and others (as
Dindorf) suppose that ἀρχή was not part
of the verse, but belonged to the words
introducing it : ἐκ τῆς Σ. δευτέρας Τυροῦς
ἀρχή ( “ opening passage "). Nauck thinks
that ἀρχή is corrupted, perhaps from ἄθρει,
and represents the first word of the verse.
On the other hand, he ejects ὄρνις.’ (J.)
’s view is not convincing, and I
prefer to suppose that ἀρχή belonged to
the introductory words, and that the
quotation was taken from the opening
scene of the play. To make this clearer
Blaydes suggests the addition of ἦς ἡ
before ἀρχή. It should be added that
in a mutilated passage of the so-called
Philetaerus of Herodian (Moeris ed.
Pierson, p. 435) ἔξεδρος. . .καὶ μὴ ἴστω
πῶς ὢν εἰς ἡμᾶς ἔξεδρον
the last words were emended by Pierson
to ἔξ. χώραν ἔχων· Σοφοκλῆς ἐν Τυροῖ β΄.
L. Cohn in Μus. XLIII 413 published
the same passage from Cod. Vat. 2226
ἔξεδρος ὁ μισοπόνηρος· καὶ μὴ ἴστω τις ὢν
εἰς ἡμᾶς ἔξεσρον χώραν ἔχων.
σατύροις, and emended it to ἔξεθρος ὄρνις·
ὁ πονηρὸς καὶ μὴ αἴσιος ὢν εἰς ἠμᾶς·
‘ἔξεδρον χώραν ἔχων’ Σοφοκλῆς βᾳ (δευτέρᾳ)
Τυροῖ. Bergk's view that this was a
passage from that quoted by the
scholiast on Aristophanes is untenable.
The meaning οf Sophocles was: ’What
is this bird in an ill-omened ’
See Hesych. 11 p. 117 ἔξεδρον· τὸν οὐΚ

<pb n="281"/>
<p>The existence of the nom. ἀρήν corresponding
sponding to the gen. ἀρνός is now securely
established by the evidence of an Attic
inscription belonging το the first half of
the fifth cent. B.C. : see Meisterhans 3
p. 142 ; Brugmann, Comp. Gr. II
p. 349 E. tr. We need not therefore
discredit the existence of a genitive
ἀρῆνος as well as ἀρνός, which is attested
by Εtym. Μ. Ρ. 140. 54 : ἀρήν, τὸ ἐπιτήδειον
εἰς εὐχὴν πρόβατον· καὶ κλίνεται
ἀρήν, ἀρῆνος· ἐξ οὖ τὸ ἀρνός κατὰ συγκοπήν.
καὶ ἀποβολῇ τοῦ ᾱ ῥήν· οἶον πολύρρηνες
πολυβοῦται (Ηομ. (Hom. I 154). That
be transferred to the ο&#x772; declension
composition is in accordance with analogy:
see on fr. 643. Consequently there would
be no diflSculty in accounting for ἀρηνοβοσκός.
But the evidence given above,
which is too strong to be resisted, indecates
that the grammarians found ἐρρηνοβοσκός
in the text of Sophocles, and
interpreted it by means of the form ἀρήν
with which they were acquainted. No
other evidence in support of a form
*ἔρρην (or *ἔρην) is quoted ; but
have been drawn from the Ionic dialect
(Smyth, § 134). Philologers must determine
whether the double ρ&#x772; is correct
the phonetic relation to ἀρήν and
A similar vowel variation occurs in ἐρρηφορεῖν:
ἀρρηφορεῖν (Meisterhans3,
The derivation of that word is quite uncertain:
for a possible explanation see
Giles in C.R. 111 222. It is evident
that no countenance should be given to
’s ἀρνοβοσκός or Bergk's ῥηνοβοσκός.
Nauck rightly withdrew his
earlier suggestions ἐρημοβοσκός and ἐρεμμοβοσκός.

<p>The information is useful and important.
Anacreon was a guest at the court of
Hipparchus c. 520 B.C., and his friendship
ship with Critias is acknowledged by
Plat. Charm. 157 E. There can be no
doubt, therefore, that the scholiast intended
to put on record the influence
exerted by Anacreon on the subsequent
metres of the tragedians. Crusius in
Pauly-Wissowa i 2042 thinks that he is
right in assigning to this source the in-
troduction of ionics into the oldest
tragedies, and refers to Phryn. frs. ὁ
and 14. The quotation from Anacreon
illustrates the appearance of the colon
— — — — — preceding the ionic dimeter :
in Aeschylus it is followed by two ἀνακλώμενα.
In spite οf the evidence of the
scholia, Schroeder refuses to recognize
the presence of ionics in Aesch. prom.
l.c. : see his analysis [Aesch. Cant. p. 38 f.).
For similar ionics in Sophocles with ἀνακλώμενα,
introduced by an iambic dimeter,
see Phil. 1174 — 1181.</p>

<p>The reference is to Sidero, the stepmother
and oppressor of Tyro: see Introductory
Note. There has naturally
been a tendency to connect her name
with her cruelty: Horn. Χ 491 ἦ γὰρ σοί
γε σιδήρεος ἐν φρεσὶ θυμός, Starkie on Ar.
Ach. 491. Hence Cobet, perceiving that
the connexion is not warranted by the
traditional text, proposed to substitute
ὡς κεκλημένη. . .Σιδηρὼ καὶ φρονοῦσα. This
is ingenious, and at first sight plausible,
although φρονεῖν τοὔνομα would require
justification. But Cobet does not notice
that (idxtfios makes his changes unnecessary
and that the integrity of the text is
supported by the evidence of Eustathius,
who declares that Sidero is represented
not as cruel but as brave or fierce. Tr.
therefore : ‘as indeed a wielder of the
sword, whose name she bears.’ The
application is just as natural as in the
cases of the Huguenot Bras de Fer and
Cromwell's Ironsides; nor ought we to
deny it to Sophocles, because the other
is the more usual. In Ai. 430 ff. the hero
derives his name from αἰαῖ, although, as
Jebb points out, it was popularly connected
with aicTds. For the word-play on the
proper name see on fr. 965, Lobeck on
Ai. 430, and Cope on Arist. rhet. l.c.
F. W. Schmidt seeks to improve the
passage by writing ὡς καὶ χρωμένη | ἀφόβως
σιδήρῳ, but σαφῶς, like ὀρθῶς, ἐτύμως
etc. (for which see on fr. 965), marks the
etymology. — For the confusion of φορεῖν

The passage from Plutarch shows that
the two extracts from Aelian do not refer

<p>2 βουκόλων is generalized of herdsmen:
so in Homer Y 221 τοῦ τρισχίλιαι

<p>3 ἀγρίᾳ χερί, according to Shorey

<p>5f. are corrupt as given in the MSS,
and have not hitherto been satisfactorily
emended. The passage of Plutarch (see
above) determines one condition to which
any reconstruction of v. 5 must conform,
namely, that the ’s presence on the
bank of the stream is part of the herdsmen's
purpose. σπασθεῖσα is suitable in
itself (Xen. eq. 7. 1), but cannot
with ἐν λειμῶνι. I propose to substitute
ἐς λειμῶνα : ἐν and εἰς are sometimes
confused (Bast in ’s Greg. Cor.
pp. 429, 726) and λειμῶνι would be a
necessary consequence of the misreading.
ἐπὶ λειμῶνα would also be possible (Bast,
p. 742; Cobet, V.L. p. 281 f.), but is
condemned by the rhythm. of the conjectures
which assume that the fault lies
with atraadelaa the best is Hartung's
σταθεῖσα, suggested independently by
Powell (C.R. XIX 230) and Paley (A.J.P.
Ill 128). H. mooted the possibility of
airaadetffa being used for σπασαμένη (see
on fr. 837), ’quaffing the water.’
quotes Phaedr. 12 ad fontem cervuw, cum
bibisset, restitit, Ι et in liquore vidit effigiem
suam, but this solution does not commend
itself. Weil adopted Hermann's σπάσουσα,
with ὑγρόν for ὑπό and κουράς in
V. 7 as the object of ἴδῃ. Blaydes conjectured
jectured ποταμίῳ ποτῷ, with αὐγάσασ’
ὕδωρ in V. ὁ. J. held that, if the text is
sound, ποτῶν is governed by ὑπό in v. 6 ;
but, apart from the difficulty αὐγασθεῖσα,
any such solution is excluded, as soon as
we perceive that the ’s intention
to bring the mare to the water must be
clearly indicated. — ποταμίων ποτῶν: the
genitive is descriptive, as we speak οf a
water-meadow: cf. σιλφίου λειμών fr. 603.
For the sense cf. Phil. 1454 Νύμφαι

genitive of definition, occurs also in
Aesch. Ag. 830, Chaeremon fr. 14, 15
(TGF p. 786). — ἀνταυγὲς τύπῳ. There
is no evidence, notwithstanding L. and S.,
that αὐγάζω κ in classical Greek ever
anything but to see, gaze at; so that, even
if ὑπό could be explained, the rendering
of αὐγασθεῖσ’ as ‘ mirrored ’ would require
justification. Hence the emendation of
Wecklein (see cr. n.), with which αὐγασθεῖσ’
would be deponent like δερχθείς
(fr. 837 n.). The sense thus obtained,
‘ gazing at the water,’ is tame and
ἴδῃ) redundant, and a reference to the
reflexion of the image seems to be required.
For this the regular words were
ἀνταυγεῖν and its cognates, and I have
accordingly restored ἀνταυγὲς τύπῳ :
Philostr. imag. 1. 22 (of Narcissus) ἐκτυπῶσάν
σε τὸ ὕδωρ, oἷδες οἷον εἶδες
οἶσθα. The loss of the first syllable of
ΑΝΤΑΥΓΕς might have been
starting-point of the error. I ought to
mention that Hartung proposed the impossible
αὐγαῖς ἔντυπον, but τύπῳ occurred
το me independently. H. was inclined to
read ὑπόν for ὑπό, but it does not appear
how he rendered αὐγασθεῖσ’.</p>
<p>7 διατετιλμένης is strictly ‘separated
by plucking,’ with the same
force as διασπᾶν, διατέμειν. L. and S.’s
rendering ’ to pluck bare ’ is misleading.
The part, agrees with σκιᾶς and the ace.
δόβην (see cr. n.) is idiomatic : see nn.
on Eur. Phoen. 267, 1403. It would be
over-subtle to suppose that διατετιλμένης
depends directly on εἴδωλον (sc. ἑαυτῆς).
The termination of φόβην was assimilated
to the preceding word by a common error
(cf. fr. 503, 3).</p>
<p>8 f. Nauck says that these lines are
‘ in libris graviter corrupti,’ but, as
remarks, it is difficult to see why. — κἄν
ἀνοικτίρμων τις οἰκτίρειέ νιν : cf. Ο. T.
1296 τοιοῦτον οἷον καὶ στυγοῦντ’
Ai. 924 ὡς καὶ παρ’ ἐχθροῖς ἄξιος
θρήνων τυχεῖν. —αἰσχύνῃσιν appears to
be the reading of the MSS, and it is better
not to interfere with it. The evidence
reported by Meisterhans 3, Ρ. 120f., establishes
blishes that up to 420 B.C. on inscriptions
the prevalent form of the dat. plural after
consonants was ησι (occasionally ῃσι),
which after 420 B.C. was superseded by
αις. Whatever the history of αισι (after
consonnats), it is clearly, so far as Attic
and Ionic are concerned, a later form:
see Weir-Smyth, Ionic Dialect, §§ 450 —
453. Wilamowitz (Einl. gr. Tr. p. 127)
concludes that no rule can be laid down
for Soph, and Eur. in this respect,
although Aesch. probably wrote ησι.
Where the MSS preserve traces of the
older forms, it seems unreasonable not
to follow them, remembering that in all
probability Sophocles himself was incon-
sistent. See also Tucker on Aesch. Theb.

<p>On what occasion did the serpents appear?
Welcker (see Introductory Note)
supposed that these lines came from a
description of Tyro's prison-house ; but
the words rather suggest a festal celebration,
and it may be conjectured that the
entertainment given by Salmoneus to
Neleus and Pelias was interrupted in the
manner described. The portent bears
some resemblance to the appearance of
the serpent in Hom. B 308 ff., but there
is a much closer parallel in the circumstances
of the sacrifice in honour of Anchieses
as related by Verg. Aen. 5. 84 ff.
See especially v. 90 ff.: ille (sc. anguis)
agmine longo | tandem inter pat eras et
levia pocula serpens | libavitque dapes,
rursiisque innoxius imo | snccessit tumulo,
et depasta altaria liquit. There too the
cups from which Aeneas had poured the
libations are described as carchesia (v. 77).</p>
<p>A similar occurrence which happened
to Tib. Gracchus in Lucania during the
Second Punic War was regarded as a
presage of misfortune : ad exta sacrificio
perpetrato angues duo ex occulto adlapsi
adedere iocur conspectique repente ex oculis
abierunt (Liv. 25. 16: cf. Val. Max. 1.
6. 8). Add Ov. Fast. 2. 711. ecce, nefas
visit, mediis altaribus anguis | exit, et
exstinctis ignibus exta rapit (Liv. i. 56).</p>
<p>1 irpocrTTivai ought to mean ‘approached,’
as is indicated by Athenaeus’
paraphrase, but that the verb could bear
this meaning and be followed by an ace.
of the place visited is not generally
credited. J ebb on Εl. 1378 ἤ σε iroWa,
δὴ Ι ἀφ’ ὦν ἔχοιμι λιπαρεῖ προὔστην χερί
held that the two passages afforded each
other mutual support in establishing the
meaning ‘to present oneself at a ’
or ’before a ’ But I think that
’s criticism is justified, viz. that,
even if προστῆναι could in ritual language
accommodate itself to the construction of
ἱκετεύω, it would not follow that it could
be applied to any voluntary entrance, nor
is it credible that the serpents presented
themselves as ἱκέται. In his text of
Athenaeus Kaibel prints ’s προσπτῆναι,
without altogether approving it ; but
to think of winged serpents is an un-
warrantable strain oii the imagination.
Schweighäuser's προσστῆναι is less
to obvious objection, and has the support
of Aesch. Fers. 206 βωμὸν προσέστην.
Nevertheless the notion οf the serpents
‘ taking up their position before the table ’
is unsuitable, and contrasts unfavourably
with ’s lapsusque per aras (v. 86)
and ’s ad exta adlapsi. Surely the
simplest remedy is προσβῆναι, a suggestion
which has been anticipated by
Hartung and Wagner. It would bear
the appropriate meaning ‘mounted the
’ for which see Headlam in J. Ρ.
XXX 309 f.</p>
<p>2 Kapx-no-ia. According to the autho-
rity of Callixenus of Rhodes (c. 220 B.C.)
quoted by Athen. 474 E (FHG III 65),
the καρχήσιον was lengthy in form,
slightly contracted towards the middle,
with two handles reaching from top to
bottom. It was suitable to a royal feast :
see Dict. Ant. 1 363
There is no reason to suppose that this
fr. refers to a dream, as was suggested by
Grenfell and Hunt (fr. 649 n.) : see

<p>With the words divorced from their

whether τελευτήσαντ’ is neut. ace. plur.
or masc. ace. sing. But, so far as con-
cerns the isolated line, the former view,
which is strongly recommended by
Tyrrell on Cic. l.c., is much the more
attractive : ‘ ’t cry till ’re out of
the ’ It is also the more likely
for two reasons : (I) μέγα εἰπεῖν is more
suitable as applied to the speaker's own
actions than to those of another ; see Ai.

Ar. Fan. 835 ; (2) the line would more
easily have become proverbial, if its
meaning were self-contained. It is not
certain that there is a reference to this
passage in Plat. Soph. 238 A, where the
Eleatic Stranger deprecates premature
boasting : τέλος γοῦν ἄν ἀπορίας ὁ λόγος
ἔχοι. — μήπω μέγ’ εἴπῃς· ἔτι γάρ, ὦ
μακάριε, ἔστι, Καὶ ταῦτά γε τῶν ἀποριῶν
ἡ μεγίστη καὶ πρώτη. The same point
without any close verbal resemblance is

<pb n="287"/>
made in Gregor. Naz. 11 p. ὁ B μηδὲν
μέγ' εἴπῃς συντόμως ἄνθρωπος ὤν,
p. 157 D μηδὲν μέγ' εἴπῃς εὐπλοῶν πρὸ
πείσματος. Plutarch (reg. et imp. apoph.
p. 184 b) relates how, when Eumenes was
reported dead and his brother Attains
had married his wife, Eumenes, returning
to Pergamus, saluted his brother in the
usual manner and whispered in his ear:
μὴ σπεῦδε γῆμαι πρὶν τελευτήσαντ' ἴδῃς.
Here the point of the parody lies in the
special application of τελευτήσαντ' ἴδῃς,
and the fact that the participle can be
treated as masc. sing, does not exclude
the possibility that it was neut. plur. in
the original. When the line stood by
itself, it was natural that it should be
connected with the famous precept of
Solon (cf. fr. 646 n.), and that τελευτήσαντ'
should be interpreted accordingly.
Hence the corruption in the MSS of
Stobaeus and Cicero (see cr. n.). EUendt
was influenced by the same consideration,
but evidently found it difficult to make
up his mind. The grammarian whose
explanation is given in ’s codex
clearly knew the passage only as a quotation:
he rightly refused to take τελευτήσαντα
as ἀποθανόντα, but, seeing the
difficulty of combining μήπω μέγ' εἴπῃς
with his interpretation of τελευτήσαντα
as εἰς τέλος ἀγαγόντα, he was reduced to
the desperate expedient of supposing that
‘ don't boast ’ was equivalent to ‘don't
admire the ’ F. W. Schmidt
escaped from this dilemma by reading
πρὶν ’Tjcras τύχῃς, but it does not
seem likely that the text is corrupt. —

that such may be the case with Phaedra:
λύπᾳ δ’ ὑπὲρ παθέων εὐναία δέδεται ψυχάν;
δυσθυμία (treated inadequately in L.
and S.) tends to express not so much
a single emotion as the state of mind in-
duced by frequent disappointment: see
El. 218, Eur. fr. 822, Theophr. fr. 120
(ap. Athen. 463 c) παραμυθεῖται γὰρ ὁ
οἶνος Kal τὴν τοῦ γήρως δυσθυμίαν, the
depression of old age. In the Stoic
system δυσθυμία is an εἷδος of λύπη
ἀλύτῳ ἢ δυσκινήτῳ), and consequently
belongs to the πάδη (Sto. vet.fr. 111 414 Arn.). Here the plural emphasizes
the recurrence of the πάθος, and it is
worth observing that the Stoics regarded
the continuance of certain emotions as
producing conditions analogous to bodily
sickness, which were accordingly de-
scribed as poa-qfiara and ἀῤῤωστήματα:

χρόνου τριβὴ is not merely the lapse of

in Plat. rep. 493 B αταμαθών τε ταῦτα

<pb n="288"/>
πάντα ξυνουσίᾳ τε καὶ χρονου τριβῇ, and
is implied in the use of τριβή for delay,
as well as in the meaning of διατριβὴ.
There is a good example in Moschion
fr. 6, 18 (p. 814 Nauck), which is parti-
cularly relevant here : iirei δ’ ὀ τίκτων
πάντα Καὶ τρέφων χρόνος Ι τὸν θνητὸν

Φύσιν διδάσκαλον, where ’long ’
is the obvious meaning. It might seem
hardly worth while to call attention to
this point, had not a failure to observe
it given unnecessary difficulty to some of
the commentators on Aesch. Αg. 471 (see
for instance ’s note). In fact,
’ powerful phrase παλιντυχεῖ
τριβᾷ βίου might be paraphrased prosaic-
ally as ’experience of ’: the
man of mere fortune cannot stand against
the wearing influence of reverse when its
turn comes. This is, I suppose, what
Kennedy meant by his ’ luck-reversing
brunt of ’ and is not far removed
from ’s view, although the latter
presses still further the meaning of τριβή.

<p>This line is supposed to refer to the

<p>παγχόρτοισιν: it does not seem pos-
sible to determine whether this word is
merely the equivalent of παντοῖος, or
whether it retains any of the contemptuous
significance which clearly attached to
χόρτος and χορτάζω as applied to human
food. For χόρτος cf. Hippon. fr. 20 σῦκα

χόρτον, and for the verb Plat. rep.

tuted χορτασθῆναι for κορεσθῆναι, adduces

<pb n="289"/>
a number of instances from comic poets
of the application of the verb to men.
The limitation is significant; and, so far
as we can tell, if Sophocles used the
adjective of human food without any de-
preciatory sense, such an employment was
exceptional. But in later Greek χορτάζεσθαι
loses its innuendo, and is generally
equivalent to ἐμπλησθῆναι, ‘ to be filled ’
with food. Cf. Epict. diss. 1. 9 19 ὄταν

The general sentiment, that birth is no
criterion of merit, is thus expressed by
Eur. El. 370: ἤδη γὰρ εἶδον ἄνδρα γενναίου
πατρὸς Ι τὸ μηδὲν ὄντα, χρηστά τ’ ἐΚ
κακῶν, There is a note of pessimism,
such as often characterizes him, in the
version of Sophocles. Cf. also Αnt. 37
δείξεις τάχα Ι εἴτ' εὐγενὴς πέφυκας εἴτ’
ἐσθλῶν ΚαΚὴ.</p>
<p>1 TToWoiv is generally suspected. Thus
Herwerden proposed οὐ πολύ with ἐσθλόν
in V. 2 and κακόν in v. 3; Blaydes, οὐ πάνυ
or βροτῶν; Mekler, πόλεων; Nauck (Ιndex,
p. xiii) λαῶν. The last is the best
suggestion that has been made, but the
uncertainty of the metre makes conjecture
hazardous. J. writes: Ἱ incline to think
that this first verse may be sound. The
redundancy of πολλῶν . . . πολυπληθίᾳ has a
cumulative emphasis, like that oi Εl. 851
πανσύρτῳ παμμήνῳ πολλῶν Ι δεινῶν στυγνῶν
τ' αἰῶνι.’ But the fact that πολλῶν is
here unqualified makes it difficult to be-
lieve in its genuineness. — πολυπληθίᾳ,
multitude, does not occur elsewhere in
tragedy; but we have TrafiirXrjdia (which
Blomfield wished to introduce here) in
fr. 373, and ἀνοδροπλήθεια in Aesch. Pers.
238. Dindorf (in Thes. s.v.) remarked
that πολυπληθείᾳ might stand here, so far
as metre is concerned.</p>
<p>2 f. ἀχρείων, as corresponding to εὐ-
γενέων, is an instance of the political
application of moral terms. From the
aristocratic point of view οἱ ἀχρεῖοι are
the rabble: Hdt. 3. 81 (the advocate (??)
oligarchy speaks) ὁμίλου γὰρ ἀχρηΐου οὐδέν
ἐστι ἀσυνετώτερον οὐδὲ ὑβριστότερον. In
Thuc. 2. 40 Pericles, representing the de-
mocracy, neatly turned the tables on the
leisured classes, who accepted the word
dirpdyfjuav as a compliment, by retorting:
τὸν μηδὲν τῶνδε (sc. τῶν πολιτικῶν) μετέχοντα
οὐΚ ἀπράγμονα ἀλλ' ἀχρεῖον νομίζομεν.
See Νeil's excellent discussion of
political nomenclature in his edition of
the Equites, pp. 202 — 209, where how-
ever, in dealing with ἀχρεῖοις at p. 208
he does not mention its application to
the masses. — to XCav is undoubtedly
corrupt. Jacobs conjectured οὕτ' ἀχρείων
ἄπο λίαν, but λίαν is unsatisfactory in any
case: other suggestions are mentioned
in the or. n. J. writes: Ἱ I would read
τοὔμπαλιν, “ contrariwise.” The similar
rhythms in the latter parts of vv. 2 and 3
indicate that these two verses were in the
same measure. τοὔμπαλιν restores this
metrical ’ The metrical con-
ditions are very uncertain: see below. —
βροτῶν. J.'s conjecture was accepted by
H. The former quotes Ο. T. 1 195 βροτῶν
οὐδὲν μακαρίζω, and his view is simpler
and better than ’s proposal to
read σπορᾷ.</p>
<p>The metre is doubtful. As the text


<pb n="290"/>
stands, vv. i, i appear to be Aeolic poly-
schematist trimeters, akin to the Asclepiad,
and the first acephalous. The nearest
parallel I can find is in Pind. Isthm. 8. 5.
See J. W. White in C. Q. III 296. The
third line, if πάλιν (e.g.) is accepted,
would be an iambic trimeter catalectic.

<p>The epithet of Dionysus was transferred
to Cratinus by Aristophanes for reasons
which may be conjectured with more or
less certainty: see Tucker in loc. In
regard to Dionysus himself, there is sufficient
evidence that a bull was a customary
sacrifice to him. At Cynaetha in Arcadia
very winter a bull was selected from the
erd, and carried to the sanctuary of
Dionysus to be sacrificed (Pausan. 8. 19.
2). At Tenedos a new-born calf was
shod in cothurni, and then sacrificed to
Dionysus; but the sacrificing priest who
used the axe was pelted with stones and
fled to the sea (Ael. hist. an. 12. 34).
The axe used in a similar sacrifice at lulis
in Ceos was called by Simonides (fr. 172)
βουφόνος depdirwv of Dionysus (Athen.
456 D, Ε). At Athens on the occasion
of the Great Dionysia the Ephebi offered
a bull to the god, after leading it in pro-
cession round the city (CIG 1 157). But
the epithet may relate to the god not so
much as the recipient of a regular and
formal sacrifice, but rather as sharing the
orgies of his worshippers, in whose per-
sons he becomes incarnate, when they
seek to establish a divine communion by
devouring the raw flesh of the sacred
animal: see Eur. Bacch. 737 ff., fr. 472
12; and for discussions bearing on the
significance of these rites Robertson Smith
in Encycl. Brit.9 xxi 137; J. G. Frazer,
G. B. 2 II p. 165; Miss J. E. Harrison,
Proleg. p. 482 ff. Hence Phot. l.c. is
justified in adding the explanation ὡμηστήν,
which other evidence ascribes to the
god as a title (Gruppe, p. 732; Rohde,
Psych4 , II p. 151), and schol. V on Ar.
l.c. adds explicitly dtrh τοῦ συμβαίνοντος
ταῖς βάκχαις. διέσπων γὰρ βοῦς καὶ ἤσθιον
ὠμὰ κρέα. For Dionysus as a bull-god
see also on fr. 959.</p>

<p>In Ar. Τhesm. 742 ἤνεγκον is immedi-
ately followed by ἤνεγκας σύ; and Cobet
(Ν.L. p. 2 f.) concluded that ἤνεγκα and
elira are equally illegitimate in Attic, and
that ἔνεγκον and ἐνέγκας are the products
of a late age. On the other hand, Ruther-
’s modified statement (Νew Phryn.
p. 220), derived from Veitch, that ’in the
indicative and imperative the forms in
alpha were used in Attic, except when the
requirements of metre or a wish to avoid
hiatus suggested ἤνεγκον and ἔνεγκον'
(?ἔνεγκε) requires correction in view of
the facts recorded by Μeisterhans 3, p. 183.
The latter shows that ἤνεγκον is the older
form, and quotes ἐνεγκέτω from inscrip-
tions of the fifth century and ἀπήνεγκον
from shortly after 403 B.C. On the other
hand, ἐνέγκας is the only recorded form of
the participle. In the first person singular
ἤνεγκον is more frequent, and, so far as
our evidence goes and excluding com-
pounds, more Attic than ἤνεγκα (Εl. 13
Eur. Ion 38). The Atticist tradition (Ael.
Dion. fr. 156 Schw., Phryn. praep. soph.
p. 73, I de B.) recognized ἤνεγκον and
ἤνεγκα as equally legitimate, so that ἁ
purpose of the Antiatticist is obscure.</p>

differently. — πάντων is the best correction
of πάντ᾿ for two reasons, (Ι) When the
chief idea is that of separation from an
object and not the wrongful act of another,
to be without something rather than to have
something kept back from oneself, the
genitive follows ἀποστερεῖσθαι in preferεence
to the accusative. Eur. Her. 137

Aeschylus Σεμέλη ἢ ‘γδροφόροι (ΤGF p. 73) that the subject
was the birth of Dionysus as related in Hygin. fab. 179 and
elsewhere. The conclusion is very doubtful, although some
might see a slight confirmation in fr. 674. E. A. I. Ahrens
held that the ὑδροφόροι in Aeschylus were the women who
attend the mother in child-birth, and bathe the new-born child.

Apart from its association with the
names of birds (ἀτταγᾶς etc.), the termina-
tion -ᾶς, when used to form common nouns,
was a vulgarism expressive of contempt :
cf. χεσᾶς, τρεσᾶς, Ψακαδᾶς (Starkie on Ar.
Ach. 1150). Karacffaydi is attributed to
Aeschylus (fr. 428, Phryn. p. 433 Lobeck).
Neil (on Ar. Eq. Kowds) holds that the
force of the suffix was similar, as applied
to proper names. It is clear that dimi-
nutives were so formed, as they often
appear beside the full name, and Blass
(Gramm. neut. Gr. p. 71) has collected
several examples from the language of
the New Testament. Lobeck pointed
out that the present notice indicates that
the suffix was not entirely colloquial;
and the name Menas, formally given to
a Spartan in Thuc. 5. 19, shows that
Athenian usage was not necessarily simi-
lar to that of the other Greeks. But we
cannot trace the associations of Bακχᾶς.</p>
<p>ΦΑΙΑΚΕΣ</p>
<p>According to Welcker 1, this play was a sequel to the Nausicaa,
containing the entrance of Odysseus into the palace of
Alcinous, the narrative of his previous history, and his dismissal
to continue his journey. Consequently he assigned to this play
frs. 861 and 965, which Brunck, followed by Dindorf (frs. 407
408), included in the fragments of the Niptra2. Welcker thought
that the words Κaὶ βορᾶς aprvfjiara (fr. 675) were part of Odys-
’ narrative, but it is at least as likely that they refer to the
Phaeacians (n.).</p>
<p>Ellendt (ς.υ. ἀρτύω), partly on the strength of fr. 1 122, held
that the Phaeacians was undoubtedly a satyr-play.</p>
<p>The evidence as to the plot and general character of the play
is too slight to warrant discussion; and it is not even certain that
<note type="footnote">1 p. 231 f.
2 He added Tr. fr. adesp. 165, which he understood to refer to Circe, but, though
the name of Sophocles (fr. 1062) precedes it in Eustathius, there is nothing else to show
that the fragment belongs to him.</note>

<pb n="294"/>
Welcker was right in finding its source in the Odyssey. For all
we know, it may have comprised the adventures of the Argonauts
in Phaeacia, as described by Apoll. Rhod. 4. 982 — 1222, when the
Colchians overtook them and demanded the surrender of Medea,
and, after Alcinous had promised to give her up in case of her
not being actually married to Jason, Arete hurried on the mar-
riage in order to prevent this result. Again, since Pollux 9. 106
refers to Ὅμηρος ἐν Φαίαξι when speaking of Nausicaa playing
ball, it is just possible that the Φαίακες of Sophocles was an
alternative title for his Nausicaa. We might then compare
fr. 675 with Hom. ζ 76, 209, 246. But the existence of the
recorded alternative YWvvTpiai makes this improbable.</p>

<p>The Phaeacians (Hom. θ 248 αἰεὶ δ’

skilled in condiments. Campbell strangely
misunderstands the Antiatticist, when he
speaks of ἤδυσμα as the later Greek equi-
valent of ἄρτυμα. The Atticists con-
demned ἀρτύω and its derivatives (Moeris,
p. 198,9 ἡδῦναι Ἀττικοί, ἀρτῦσαι Ἕλληνες);
and Sophocles is cited to confute them.</p>

they condemned the word itself as post-

trary, even if the present evidence were
wanting.</p>
<p>ΦΑΙΔΡΑ</p>
<p>Welcker held that the plot of the Phaedra, which in its
principal features seems to have resembled the Hippolytus of
Euripides, agreed in detail with the account of Asclepiades
preserved in schol. V Hom. λ 321 (FHG III 305). According
to him, Theseus, after marrying the daughter of Minos, desired
to protect his son Hippolytus from possible injury at the hands

<pb n="295"/>
of his stepmother, and consequently sent him to exercise the
sovereignty at Troezen which he himself had inherited through
Aethra. Phaedra, who had fallen in love with Hippolytus, built
a temple to Aphrodite at Athens, and on her subsequent arrival
at Troezen endeavoured to move Hippolytus to compliance.
When he repulsed her overtures, she was alarmed and invented
a counter-charge against him. accusing him to Theseus of having
assailed her honour. Theseus believed her, and prayed to
Poseidon that, by destroying Hippolytus, he would accomplish
in his favour one of the three wishes which he had promised to
fulfil for him. While Hippolytus was exercising his chariot on
the shore, a bull came out of the sea, and the scared horses
overturned the car and dragged Hippolytus to destruction.
Phaedra, when her slander was exposed, hanged herself. The
principal points in which this story differs from the extant play
of Euripides are (i) the shamelessness of Phaedra's direct over-
tures; and (2) the suicide of Phaedra after the detection of her
treachery. Apollod. epit. i. 18, 19 agrees in regard to both
points, but makes no mention of Troezen. Diod. 4. 62 makes
Phaedra return from Troezen to Athens and there give informa-
tion to Theseus. In other respects his story is rationalized:
the influence of Poseidon has disappeared, the fatal accident
to Hippolytus was the consequence of his mental agitation, and
’s suicide was due to the fear of detection. Pausan. i.
22. 2, who, though professing to give the Troezenian legend,
clearly depends on Euripides, gives as ’s reason for the
sending away of Hippolytus his desire to prevent any rivalry
from arising between him and the children who might be born
to Phaedra.</p>
<p>But, although the currency of certain variations in the details
of the story is established by these authorities, there is nothing
to connect them with Sophocles. When Welcker suggests that
the presentation of Phaedra by Sophocles differed entirely from
the portrait with which we are familiar, that is probable enough;
but in assigning to the Sophoclean Phaedra a shameless hardness
of character he is speculating without any evidence to support
him. Hence his view was rightly rejected by Leo (Obs. in Senec,
Ρ. 174) and Kalkmann (de Hipp. Eur. Ρ. 47). On the other
hand, it is certain that in the Hippolytus καλυπτόμενος οφ
Euripides the character of Phaedra was represented in a much
more odious light than in the revised play (TGF p. 491). Hence
it has been suggested that the versions of Ovid (Her. 4) and of
Seneca in his Phaedra, in which the same features appear, were
derived wholly or in part from the Ἱππόλυτος αλυπτόμενος
(see Wilamowitz, Anal. Eur. Ρ. 209, and Herm. XV 483).</p>

<pb n="296"/>
<p>It must be admitted that we know little or nothing concerning
the Phaedra of Sophocles which helps us to discover its character.
It is, however, certain that in the course of the play Theseus
returned from his unfortunate expedition to the underworld (see
frs. 686, 687 with the nn.); and it is remarkable that the order of
events is the same in Ovid (v. 109) and in Seneca (vv. 98, 225
843). But it would be unsafe to infer further identity 1 of treat-
ment from that coincidence, for Euripides in his earlier play may
have represented the absence of Theseus as due to the same
cause (fr. 443). Kalkmann (l.c. p. 44) was perhaps justified in
concluding from Ar. Ran. 1043 ff. that ’ portrait of
Phaedra must have been at least free from grosser traits; and,
if that is so, her infatuation may have been excused as the
consequence of her ’s desertion, who had abandoned
her to assist his friend in a hopeless expedition. Similar
suggestoins have been made by R. Wagner, Epit. Vat. Ρ. 143
and Gruppe, p. 606 2, as well as by Ilberg in Roscher III 2223
who thinks that ’ play in point of date came between
the two plays of Euripides. On the other hand, Wilamowitz is
confident that the Phaedra of Sophocles was subsequent to the
extant Hippolytus, and that its principal purpose was to reinstate
the reputation of the heroine. He argues (Eur. Hipp. p. 57) that
fr. 682 is part of a polemic directed against the Euripidean
standpoint, that fr. 683 perhaps refers to the political debate
in the Supplzces, and that the expedition to the underworld was
reintroduced into the story with the specific object explained
above.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Weil, Sept tragedies d' Euripide, p. ὁ, thinks the lines unsuitable to the supposed
occasion, on the ground that Theseus had fortunately escaped from peril. But, though
his life had been saved by Heracles, his own expedition was a disastrous failure.
However this may be, in the extant Hippolytus the absence of Theseus is differently
accounted for (792), and the whole scheme of his residence at Troezen (34) is incon-
sistent with the undertaking of an expedition to the underworld. Observing that
Seneca laid the scene of action at Athens, we are entitled to infer that a play which
introduced the return from Hades would agree also with Seneca in the matter of
locality. The inference is valid for Sophocles, but is obviously less cogent in regard
to the καλυπτόμενος. No weight can be assigned to the reading of the MSS in the
Argument of Aristophanes: ἡ σΚηνὴ τοῦ δράματος ἐν θήβαις κεῖται. This patent
blunder is usually corrected to ἐν Τροιζῆνι. Schwartz however emended: ἐν &#x003C;
καὶ οὐ καθάπερ τοῦ προτέρου ἐν &#x003E; ’ Ἀθήναις, and Murray accepts ἐν ’Adrjvais, thinking
that it may apply to the earlier play. ’s conclusions on these points (Pauly-
Wissowa vin 1865) are much too positive. Wilamowitz made much of his contention
that in the καλυπτόμενος Theseus escaped from Hades by means of the second of the
three wishes which Poseidon had promised to fulfil. The only solid support for his
argument is the statement of schol. Eur. Hipp. 887, which says nothing at all about
Euripides.</note>

suggestion, apparently without being

was disposed to make a distinction be-
tween the adverbial use of prepositions
and their so-called tmesis: see his nn.
on Ο.Τ. 27, El. 299, Ant. 1107. The
distinction is not always easy to maintain,
and the term ’tmesis,’ if strictly under-
stood, is historically misleading : Monro,
Η. G. § 176. No doubt, however, in
consequence of the increase in the num-
ber of compound verbs since the time of
Homer, the tragic poets were consciously
archaizing when they separated the pre-
position : see Wilamowitz on Eur. Her.
53. It should be added that usually in
Sophocles the prep, is placed at the
beginning of the clause (Kuehner-Gerth,
§ 445, 6 : but cf. fr. 796). The substitution
of γυναικί was a natural error (see on fr.
659, 5), and ἐν and σύν are constantly
confounded (fr. 724, Cobet, V. L. p. 199
Coll. Crit. p. 293). – ’Nauck formerly
conj. εὖ γυναῖκα δεῖ στέγειν. He now
reads, after Vitelli and F. W. Schmidt,
δεῖ γυναῖκ' ἀεὶ στέγειν (quite unwarrantably).
R. Ellis prefers 'en γυναικὶ δεῖ
στέγειν, " in the case of a woman ": but
this seems weak here, where only women
are in question. Worst of all is ’s
τὴν γυναῖκα δεῖ στέγειν.' (J.) Add that
Grotius adopted ἐν γυναιξί, and Ellendt
σὺν γυαιξὶ δεῖ στέγειν. P. Schroeder
proposed συγγύναικα. Η. conj. σιγῶσαν
(or σιγώσῃ?) in v. i, following Nauck,
as I suppose, in v. 2 : this is as if the
’s silence were alone in question.

<p>1 μέν. The Greeks saw a contrast
everywhere, and sometimes overdid it :
so here there is no real opposition be-
tween the μέν- and δέ-clauses, but the
δέ-clause corroborates the fxiv-clanse.
‘Since Since heaven-sent disgrace cannot be
avoided, we must bear ’ See also
Jebb on At. 622 ff. Holzner, quoting
such passages as Aesch. fr. 362 οὔτ' ἐν
στέγῃ τις ἤμενος παρ' ἐστίᾳ Ι Φεύμει τι
μᾱλλον τὸν πεπρωμένον μόρον, and Eur.
Ηclid. 615 μόρσιμα δ’ οὔτι Φυγεῖν θέμις,
proposed to substitute a χρή for αἴσχη.
But the context probably warranted the
mention of disgrace, to avoid which was
’s special concern in Eur. Hipp.
405ff., 498ff.</p>
<p>2 Brunck was not justified in reading
ᾦ ye (ῷ περ Dobree, οἶσι Hermann), for
Koi after the relative is entirely idiomatic.
It marks the statement of the relative
clause as corresponding to, sometimes
actually as limiting, that of the main
sentence : see e.g. Dem. 5. 16 καὶ γὰρ
αἰ συμμαχίαι τοῦτον ἔχουσι τὸν τρόπον,
ὧν καὶ Φροντίσειεν ἄν τις. This simple
use of καί has also troubled the editors
in Horn. A 249.—ἐφορμήσῃ, immiserit.
This use of the verb does not occur else-
where in tragedy, but is Homeric (Γ 165)
and Ionic : see Lexx. For the omission
of ἄν see on fr. 659, 4. Cf. Ο. C. 252 οὐ

<p>The critics are not of much assistance
in elucidating this difficult fragment.
Nauck says: ‘ de restituendo loco despero:
sed V. I pro ἀριθμεῖν verbo potius ἐρευνᾶν
’ But that leads nowhere. Cobet
(Coll. Crit. p. 198), after making the bad
conjecture διευτυχοῦντα, adds: ’reliqua
non ’ Grotius, who restored τὸν
δ’ εὐτυχοῦντα and ἀριθμήσας, has, I think,
followed a false scent, which has misled
many τὸν εὐτυχοῦντα Papageorgius, σὺ
δ’ εὐτυχοῦντα Enger, τοὺς δ’ εὐτυχοῦντας
Wecklein, πᾶν ἐυτυχοῦντα πάντας ἀθρήσας
F. W. Schmidt). Others have found fault
with οὖτος ὄντως Gesner — a doubtful
word for Sophocles [Wilamowitz on Eur.
Her. 611: see however his Eur. Hipp.
p. 57, where he approves the conjecture,
holding the play to be late]; ἶκος — or
ὁρθῶς with βροτόν in v. 1 — F. W. Schmidt).
J. writes: ‘ On the whole I would read
τὸν δ’ εὐτυχοῦντα (with Grotius) and
explain thus: "But as for the fortunate
man, — when thou hast reckoned up all
things, there is not one mortal whom
thou wilt find (to be such)." The article
may be explained by the position of τὸν
δ’ εὐτυχοῦντα at the beginning of the
sentence — denoting that ὁ εὐτυχῶν is the
object of the search. Cp. Her. i. 32
οὖτος ἐκεῖνος τὸν σὺ ζητέεις, ὁ ὄλβιος
κεκλῆσθαι ἄξιός ἐστι.’ He might have
quoted Ο. Τ. 449 τὸνδνδρa τοῦτον, ὃν
πάλαι ζητεῖς. . . ἐστιν ἐστιν : but
neither the treatment of οὖτος nor the
combination of πάντ' ἁριθμήσας is satis-
factory. As an alternative, J. recon-
stituted the first line as ra δ’ ἔσθλ' ἔχοντα
πάντ' ἀριθμῆσαι βροτῶν, ‘one who can
count (as his own) all good ’
Tucker (C. R. xvII 191) proposed rd δ’
εὐτυχοῦντα πάντ' ἀριθμήσς, . . .οὖ προσόντ'
ἐνευρήσεις ἔνα. Headlam, without dis-
cussing the difficulty of the first line,
thought the second should be οὐΚ ἔστιν
οὐ (or ᾖ or οὐκ ἔσθ' ὅπου) τοῖόν τιν’ (or
τοιοῦτον) εὑρήσεις ἔνα (J. Ρ. XX 305).
Holzner re- wrote as follows : οὐΚ ἔστιν
fort. ἐνόν
οὖτος πράγματ' ἀθρήσας βροτῶν Ι ὃν εὐτυ.
χοῦντ' ἄπαντ' ἐφευρήσεις ἀεί, but was
afterwards contented with a milder
remedy τὸν εὐτυχοῦντα, πάντ’ ἀριθμήσας,
ἀεί. . . βροτῶν (Philol. LV 566). Papa-
basileios conjectured ποῦ δ’ εὐτυχοῦντα
πάντ' ἂν ἀθρήσαις βροτόν; Blaydes
finally preferred: πάντ' εὐτυχοῦντα πᾶν
ἀριθμήσας γένος Ι οὐΚ ἔστιν οὐδεὶς ὅντιν'
εὑρήσεις βροτῶν.</p>
<p>I think it will hardly be disputed that
the general sentiment is the same as that
of Eur. fr. 45 ὥστ’ οὔτις ἀνδρῶν εἰς
ἄπαντ' εὐδαιμονεῖ, and fr. 661 οὐΚ ἔστιν
ὅστις πάντ' ἀνὴρ εὐδαιμονεῖ (quoted by
Cobet). Cf. Bacchyl. 5. 53 οὐ γάρ τις
ἐπιχθονίων Ι πάντα γ' εὐδαίμων ἔφυ, Pind.
Nem. 7.55 τυχεῖν δ’ ἕν' ἀδύνατον Ι εὐδαιμονίαν
ἅπασαν ἀνελόμενον. Surely Heath and
Musgrave were right in Eur. Ion 382
where they restored ἔνa δ’ dp εὐτυχῆ. . .
βίον. Pausan. 8. 24. 14 dvdpa δὲ συμφορῶν
ἀεὶ στάντα ἐκτὸς. . . οὐκ ἔστιν ὅπως δυνησόμεθα
ἐξευρεῖν. That is to say, πάντ'
must be construed with εὐτυχοῦντα. On
the other hand, the form of the main
sentence is an echo of Hom. ζ 201 οὐΚ
ἔσθ' οὖτος ἀνὴρ διερὸς βροτός, οὐδὲ γένηται, Ι
ὅς κεν. . . ἴκηται, and π 437 οὑκ ἔσθ' οὖτος
ἀνὴρ οὐδ’ ἔσσεται οὑδὲ γἐνηται, Ι ὄς κεν. . .
ἐποίσει, so that οὖτος looks forward. If
these premisses be granted, I believe that
the reading of Μ may be translated thus:
’As for counting a man happy in all
respects, there lives not that mortal
whom you will discover such — no ! not
’ The introductory infinitive with
the article is thus parallel to Trach. 545
τὸ δ’ αὖ ξυνοικεῖν τῇδ' ὁμοῦ τίς ἂν γυνὴ Ι
δύναιτο ; and the leaning of Sophocles to
such constructions is well known. I feel,
however, some doubt about iva, and, but
for the existence of such passages as Eur.
Hclid. 328 ἔνα γὰρ ἐν πολλοῖς ἴσως Ι εὓροις
ἂν ὅστις ἐστὶ μὴ χείρων πατρός, Astyd. fr. 8
(TCP p. 780) ἐν ἐκατόν ἐστιν εὑρεῖν ἄνδρ'
ἔνα, should have more confidence in pro-
posing ἐνόν, which would give additional
support to the introductory infinitive.

<p>1 οὕτε may be inferential ( = itaque),
a rare usage, which occurs in Sophocles
perhaps only at Ant. 677 οὔτως ἀμυντἐ’
ἐστὶ τοῖς κοσμουμένοις. F. W. Schmidt,
and independently Gomperz, proposed
οὕτοι, which is accepted by Nauck. But,
though οὕτω seems unnatural, it is rash
to alter it in the absence of the context.
In Aesch. Suppl. 779 Schuetz proposed
οὕτοι in the place of an inferential οὕτω:
but he has not succeeded in convincing
the editors. See also on Eur. Ηel. 810.
Wilamowitz (Eur. Hipp. p. 57) quotes
Eur. Ion 400, which is not an instance,
and Suppl. 917, which is doubtful. He
argues that the speaker is summing up

deprecating the universal hatred of women
preached by Euripides in the Hippolytus.</p>
<p>2 κτἠσαιτ' ἄν: Nauck conjectured
λᾐσαιτ' ἄν, on account οf the passages

paraphrase the thought without repro-
ducing the actual words.</p>
<p>3 παθὼν. . . λέγει: each man gives his

iraddiv holds the place of emphasis, since
the thought is intended to echo Hes. Op.

ῥεχθὲν δέ τε ἤπιος ἔγνω): see also Blom-

The figure is not so completely worked

a team urged by a malicious charioteer
to trample under foot his more scrupulous
opponents. So Theogn. 846 λὰξ ἐπίβα

Whether in using κέντρα he implied
anything more than a symbol of power,
— or, in other words, whether he was
consciously suggesting the mental in-
centives by which the demagogue sways
his hearers, — must remain uncertain, al-
though the word κέντρον often bears the
latter meaning (e.g. in Aesch. Eum 430).
It is curious that κέντρα occurs, though
with a different application, in the similar
context of Eur. Suppl. 240 ff. oἲ δ’ οὐΚ

consequently assumed that the error lay
with Stobaeus, and remarked that the
style clearly betrayed the hand of Euri-
pides. There is no definite peculiarity
of diction which can be used as evidence;
and here, as in fr. 941, Nauck was in-
fluenced rather by the reflective tone
than by considerations of vocabulary and
structure. Such impressions are often
illusory; and, if the external evidence
is examined alone, it appears somewhat
more probable that Clement (or his
source) erred in naming Euripides, than
that the anthologist blundered in the
name of the play as well as in that of the
author. Elter and Hense both think that
Stobaeus was right, and the latter adds
that the style is not remarkable in a late
play. Musgrave took the view that the
first three lines belonged to Euripides,
and the last two to Sophocles.</p>

easy sway of Love: cf. fr. 941, 15 Διὸς

suppose that the poet by the use of
θέλων attempted to reconcile the omni-

Love, much as the Stoics recommended
a free acceptance of Necessity (Cleanth.

this fragment among the adespota on the

The same view is assumed by

that μῶλυς is the lemma to which the

by Sophocles as a feminine adjective, being

of a  tragedy of character. The title warrants us in assuming 
(1) that the action of the play took place at Phthia, and (2)
that female interest was prominent. These conditions do
not fit Campbell’s guess that the subject was the education of
Achilles. But it is not easy to find an appropriate story.


<pb n="306"/>
Perhaps the most likely solution is that Phthiotides was an
alternative title to the Hermione1. In that case fr. 695 might
be referred to Peleus and Phoenix, whom Hyginus (fab. 257)
includes in a list of examples of mutual friendship. Fr. 696
might be connected with the parricidal impulse to which Phoenix
confesses in Hom. I 458 — 461; but I should prefer to explain it
in reference to the claim made by Neoptolemus against Apollo
that he should pay the penalty for the death of Achilles : see
Eur. Andr. 53, 1108, Or. 1657. Then πατροκτόνος δίκη would
be a ‘trial for slaying the father of another I just as in Eur. Or.
193 Electra calls Clytaemnestra πατροφόνου ματρός, and in Soph.
Trach. 1 125 Heracles describes Deianira to Hyllus as πατροφόντου
μητός.</p>
<p>Ahrens conjectured that the subject-matter was taken from
the earlier adventures of Peleus, as related by Apollod. 3. 163 ff.,
and particularly from the tragic incidents which followe his
marriage to Antigone the daughter of Eurytion.</p>

<p>ΦΙΛ0ΚΤΗΤΗΣ EN Ο ΤΡΟΙΑΙ</p>
<p>There cannot be much doubt that the leading events recorded
in the philoctetes at Troy were the healing of Philoctetes, and his
slaying of Paris. The Little Iliad contained the earliest version
of the story of which we have any knowledge. The abstract of
Proclus (EGF p. 36) runs thus: μετὰ ταῦτα Ὁδυσσεὺς λοχήσας
Ἕλενον λαμβάνει, κaὶ χρήσαντος περὶ τῆς ἀλώσεως τούτου Διομήδης
ἐΚ Δήμνου Φιλοκτήτην ἀνάγει. ἱαθεὶς δὲ οὖτος ὑπὸ Μαχάονος
Κaὶ μονομαχήσας Ἀλεξάνδρῳ Κτείνει· Κaὶ τὸν νεκρὸν ὑπὸ</p>


<pb n="308"/>
<p>Μενελάου καταικισθέντα ἀνελόμενοι θάπτουσαιν οἱ Τρῶες. The
death of Paris, the original offender, which Philoctetes alone was
destined to achieve, was the climax towards which the action of
the play was directed. There is nothing in the extant fragments
which gives any clue concerning the development of the plot.</p>
<p>The events in question are summarized in the prophetic
speech of Heracles in phil. 1423 ff.: ἐλθὼν δὲ σὺν τῷδ' ἀνδρὶ πρὸς τὸ
τρωικὸν Ι πόλισμα, πρῶτον μὲν νόσου παύσῃ λυγρᾶς, Ι ἀρετῇ τε
πρῶτος ἐκκριθεὶς στρατεύματος Ι πάριν μέν, ὃς τῶνδ' αἴτιος κακῶν
ἔφυ, Ι τόξοισι τοῖς ἐμοῖσι νοσφιεῖς βίου, Ι πέρσεις τε Τροίαν κτἑ.
Further on (v. 1437) he promises : ἐγὼ δ' Ἀσκληπιὸν Ι παυστῆρα
πέμψω σῆς νόσου πρὸς Ἵλιον. This raises a difficulty, because in
V. 1333 Neoptolemus had assured Philoctetes, on the authority
of Helenus, that the sons of Asclepius would effect his cure. It
has not been satisfactorily explained why Sophocles allowed an
inconsistency, of which he must have been aware, to appear after
so short an interval. It is therefore idle to speculate whether
the writer of this play, like most of the later authorities1, followed
the Little Iliad in ascribing to Machaon the performance of the
cure, or whether he agreed with the minority 2 in preferring
Podalirius.</p>
<p>Dindorf prints with the fragments of this play (fr. 632) two
lines which are twice quoted by Plutarch (an seni sit ger. resp. 9
p. 789 A, Solon 20) as addressed to Philoctetes :
<lg>
<l>τίς δ' ἄν σε νύμφη, τίς δὲ πάρθενος νέα</l>
<l>δέξαιτ' ἄν; εὖ γοῦν ὡς γαμεῖν ἔχεις, τάλας.</l>
</lg>
Hermann first assigned these lines to the present play, which
he strangely thought was satyric. They had previously been
ascribed to Euripides; but Matthiae took a different line, in
referring them to the Philoctetes of Strattis ( 111 609 K.). Her-
werden argued that the lines must be tragic, on the ground that
in comedy the vocative of τάλας is always rdXav (Εxerc. Crit.
p. 87). It is not clear that the criterion applies, but in the
present state of our knowledge Nauck is right in classing the
fragment with the tragic adespota (fr. 10); for it is either tragic,
or paratragoedic.</p>
<p>Blaydes (on Soph. phil. 357) thought that the line οὐ παῖς
Ἀχιλλέως, ἀλλ' ἐκεῖνος αὐτὸς εἶ (Tr. fr. adesp. 363) might have
been taken from the Philoctetes at Troy. But, if Sophoclean at
all, it is more relevant to the plot of the Scyrians.</p>

The construction is less remark-

rate — supported by a noun: see Ai. 41
Τrach. 269, O.T. 697, Phil. 327, 751
1308. Yet (e.g.) in Ai l.c. Xόλῳ βαρυνθεὶς
τῶν Ἀχιλλείων ὅπλων it is clear that
ὅπλων is at least as much affected by
βαρυνθείς as by χόλῳ. Delbriick, Vergl.
synt. § 89, treats some of these genitives
as ablatival in origin, but it is very hard
to draw the line between the genitive
and ablative which probably fell together.

<p>ΦΙΝΕΥΣ A AND B</p>
<p>The story of Phineus and his sons, so far as it is given by-
Sophocles himself in the Antigone (966 — 987), is as follows.
Phineus dwelt at Salmydessus in Thrace, on the west coast of
the Euxine, and close to the Bosporus. His first wife was
Cleopatra, the daughter of Boreas, but she either died 1 or was
put away and imprisoned. Phineus married again ; and the
<note type="footnote">1 Jebb (on v. 966) thinks that the intention of the poet was to compare Antigone
with Cleopatra, and that the imprisonment of the latter is implied in 986. The point
is doubtful; and the schol. certainly thought otherwise, as appears from his allusion
to the death of Cleopatra and from the words τῆς Κλεοπάτρας παῖδας ἐν τάφῳ
καθεῖρξεν. There was however a version which made Cleopatra survive, as we
shall see.</note>

<pb n="312"/>
cruel stepmother 1 dealt a blinding wound to Cleopatra's two
sons, using her shuttle as a dagger to strike them in the eyes.
So their high lineage did not avail to save them from a miserable
doom.</p>
<p>Sophocles does not give the reason of the ’s cruelty,
but this is supplied by other authorities. It is a story of a well-
known type. The stepmother, whose name is variously recorded,
chagrined, we may suppose, at a repulse by one of them, accused
her stepsons to their father of attempting to violate her. Phineus
believed her accusation, and blinded them, but was himself
afflicted with blindness as a punishment either by Zeus, or, ac-
cording to Apollodorus, by the Argonauts, who were sailing
along the coast with Boreas in their company. See ApoUod.
3. 200, Hygin. fab. 19, schol. Ov. Ib. 265, 2711</p>
<p>Asclepiades 3, who gives to the stepmother the name Eurytia,
states that Zeus offered to Phineus the alternative of death or
blindness. Phineus chose the latter, and the sun-god, incensed
in consequence, afflicted him yet further by sending the Harpies
to persecute him. We thus pass to the later history of Phineus,
which is familiar from the Argonautica of Apollonius (2. 178 ff.).
Here the Argonauts appear as the rescuers of Phineus, not, as in
Apollodorus, as his punishers. Phineus had been punished with
blindness and the unremitting persecution of the Harpies because
of an act of impiety: endowed with powers of divination, he had
revealed more of the future than was ’’. He welcomed the
Argonauts and promised to show them the means whereby they
might pass through the Symplegades, and so reach Colchis, if
only they would deliver him from the plague of the Harpies.
Accordingly, Calais and Zetes, the sons of Boreas, attacked the
Harpies, and drove them away as far as the Strophades islands,
where they desisted from the pursuit.</p>
<p>Sophocles wrote two plays entitled Phineus; and, if we turn
to the fragments which have been preserved, we find clear traces
<note type="footnote">1 Her name is not given. Sophocles called her Idothea in the Tympanistae
(fr. 645), but Idaea in a play which is not named (fr. 704). Cf. Ov. Rem. Am. 454.
2 The story has been traced back to Hesiod (fr. 54) through Serv. Verg. Aen.
3. 209.
3 Schol. Hom. μ 69 (FHG in 302). The schol. Ap. Rh. 2. —181 (Etym.
gen. ap. Reitzenstein, Ind. lect. acad. Rost. 1891/92 makes the alternatives the
possession of the art of divination coupled with blindness on the one hand, and a
short life in normal condition on the other. On Phineus choosing the former Apollo
was incensed and maimed him. This particular version is absurd, since ’s
action involves no further punishment. Nevertheless something of the kind was
related by Hesiod in the Catalogi (fr. 52), which was undoubtedly the ultimate literary
source bearing on the connexion of Phineus with the Argonauts (Sittig in Pauly-
Wissowa VII 2424).
4 Hes. fr. 151 made his crime consist in showing the way to Phrixus; and there
are other variants.</note>

<pb n="313"/>
of the later history of Phineus in frs. 709, 713 and 714, which
seem to refer to the attacks of the Harpies, and in fr. 712, which
describes the emaciated condition of Phineus himself. On the
other hand, frs. 715 and 710 undoubtedly refer to the blinding
of the Phineidae. Fr. 710, which testifies to the cure of the two
sons by Asclepius, is corroborated by the parallel statement of
Phylarchus (fr. 17, FHG I 338)1, who adds that it was his in-
tention to gratify Cleopatra. From Α. Ρ. 3. 4 it appears that,
according to one version of the story, the Phineidae ultimately
put their stepmother to death, in order to avenge their ’s
wrongs, and that Cleopatra survived, and was present to rejoice
in the act of justice 2. Diodorus (4. 43, 44), in a rationalized
narrative, confirms the final victory of Cleopatra and her sons,
whom he supposes to have been rescued by the Argonauts.</p>
<p>We are justified in concluding from these facts that the two
plays of Sophocles were concerned with the history of ’s
cruelty and the punishment of Phineus respectively; and that
the first play ended with the rescue of the Phineidae and the
execution of their vengeance, and the second with the release
of Phineus from the Harpies. To speculate further on the
details, as for example whether Cleopatra shared in her ’
triumph, seems unprofitable.</p>
<p>Welcker3 treated the account of Asclepiades 4 as furnishing
the basis of the plot, and held that the Phineus was produced
in a revised edition, which he identified with the Tympanistae.
His theory was approved by Dindorf, but may now be regarded
as obsolete, in so far as it limits the activity of Sophocles to the
composition and revision of a single play. G. Wolff in Philol.
XXVIII 343 i. identified the Tympanistae with the earlier Phineus,
the plot of which was to be found in schol. Ant. 980 and schol.
Ap. Rhod. 2. 178. He avoided the difficulty arising from the
name Idothea, which is said to have been given to the step-
mother in the Tympanistae, by supposing that in fr. 645 the
words Ka-ra δέ τινας. . . ἀδελφήν are parenthetic, and that ἧς refers
to Idaea. But the natural interpretation of the scholium rather
points to a contrast between καὶ αὐτὸς Σοφοκλῆς and κατά τινας.
I think, however, that Wolff was right in refusing to attach much
<note type="footnote">1 Bakhuyzen, de parodia, p. 185, wrongly refers this to the healing of Phineus,
notwithstanding the evidence of Phylarchus.
2 μητρυιὰν Κλύτιος Καὶ κλυτόνοος Πολυμήδης Ι κτείνουσι Φρυγίην, ματρὸς ὐπὲρ σφετέρας.
Ι Κλειοπάτγρη δ’ ἐπὶ τοῖσιν ἀγάλλεται, ἥ σφιν ἐπεῖδεν Ι τὰν Φινέως γαμετὰν
δαμναμένην ὁσίως. Idaea is called a Phrygian, as the daughter of Dardanus. Her
barbarian origin explains her cruelty : Diodorus makes her a Scythian, just as
Sophocles made Idothea a Phoenician (fr. 645).

did not preserve the plots of single plays. See Pauly-Wissowa 11 1628.</note>

importance to the disagreement of the schol. Ap. Rhod. 2. 178
to which may now be added Etym. gen. cod. Vat. (fr. 705), with
fr. 645 as well as with Soph. Ant. 973, in respect to the state-
ment that the blinding of his sons was the act of Phineus
himself For by giving credit to the slander of his wife, and
delivering his sons into her power, Phineus made himself
responsible for her cruelty.
’s view of the second Phineus was the same as that
which has been taken above 1 , and he made a good point in
suggesting that Sophocles may have found occasion to exhibit
the chastening effect of suffering upon the character of Phineus,
just as Oedipus changes in the interval between the two plays
which bear his name. Jessen2 held that in the first Phineus
Phineus himself blinded his sons at the instigation of Idaea,
and that their sight was subsequently restored by Asclepius.
On the other hand, he believes that the Tympanistae was a
distinct play, though dealing with the same material. Here
Idothea blinded her stepsons with kερκίδες, and threw them
into a dungeon, after ’s death. The sequel related
the punishment of Phineus by the Argonauts, to whom the
mention of Colchis in fr. 638 points. Boreas was with them,
and was the speaker of fr. 637. Jessen's view is deserving of
approval in so far as it is the only one which does not go
beyond or strain the evidence ; but the result — a double treat-
ment of the same story in different plays 3 — does not commend
itself as probable. It must be admitted that, with the evidence
at our disposal, the problem of the Tympanistae is insoluble.</p>
<p>Aeschylus wrote a Phineus, produced with the Persae in
472 B.C., which is known to have referred to the Harpies (TGF
p. 83). Aesch. Eum. 50 also shows that the Harpies were
represented in contemporary art 4 . Aristotle has a mysterious
allusion to an otherwise unknown play entitled Φινεῖδαι: Poet.
16. 1455 a 10 κaὶ ἡ (ἀναγνώρισις) ἐν τοῖς Φινείδαις, ἰδοῦσαι γὰρ
τὸν τόπον συνελογίσαντο τὴν εἰμαρμένην ὅτι ἐν ὅτι ἐν τούτῳ εἴμαρτο

in the extant versions of the legend of Phineus which helps to
<note type="footnote">1 So also Ribbeck, p. 540, and Jessen in Roscher ill 2361, so that this result
appears to be well settled. The original form of the story, in which Phineus was
punished for disobedience to the gods, was entirely distinct from that of his treatment
of his sons. This is shown by the conflicting roles of the Argonauts.
2 Roscher ill 2362.
will It will be observed that the effect is much the same as that of ’s revised
edition. Hiller v. Gaertingen, p. 59 ff., had taken a similar view, holding that Apollo-
dorus reproduced the substance of the first Phineus, and that in the Tympanistae
Idothea blinded and imprisoned the Phineidae.

explain this. Nor can anything be made Οf the fragments
attributed to the Phinidae of Accius. However, it is clear
that the blinding Οf the Phineidae was a favourite incident of
the tragic stage. Thus Timocles in the Λιονυσιάζουσαι (ΙΙ 453
K.), perhaps in reference to Sophocles’ play: τοὺς γὰρ τραγῳδοὺς

<p>If we may press these words to their
full extent, Sophocles is made to represent
the blinding of Phineus as a punishment
for his own act in blinding his
sons at the instigation of Idaea. See

sons are elsewhere given as Plexippus

</lg>
<p>710 Αr. Plut. 634 — 636 ‘ἀντὶ. . . τυχών.’
Schol. rec. on v. 635 (i.e. as reported ori-
ginally in the Aldine ed.) says : ἐΚ Φινέως
Σοφοκλέους ὁ στίχος. Schol. V on v. 636
says: ἀντὶ τοῦ εὐμενεστάτον. ταῦτα δὲ ἐΚ
τοῦ Φινέως Σοφοκλέους ἔλαβεν. Aelian
hist. an. 17. 20, quoting from Aristotle's
account of the white swallow, which, if
its eyes are stabbed out, becomes blind
for the moment, adds: μετὰ ταῦτα δὲ
ἐξωμμάτωται Καὶ λελάμπρυνται
κόρας Κaὶ ἐξ ὑπαρχῆς ὁρᾷ, ὡς ἐκεπινός
Φησι.</p>
<p>It is strange that Nauck has omitted
to refer to Aelian. His evidence is im-
portant, as showing that v. 2 was a fami-
liar quotation; and, although he does not
refer to his source, the citation makes it
more likely that Sophocles was the author
of the line. For, if it had been a jest
of Aristophanes, a parody of Sophocles
rather than an actual transcript of his
words, the inherent absurdity of the
quotation would have made it less suit-
able for ’s purpose. Anyhow,
Nauck was clearly right in withdrawing
from the position which he took up in
his first edition, that only v. 636 of the
Plutus belongs to Sophocles. Cobet
mad the just remark ‘ Scholia in Codd.
non ad certum versum ’ (Coll.
Crit. p. 199); and their evidence here
is not sufficient to determine exactly the
limits of the quotation (or parody).
Hence I have added the words ἀντὶ γὰρ
τυφλοῦ, which, whether Sophoclean or
not, are necessary for the completion of
the period. Unfortunately, the whole
context in Aristophanes is paratragoedic,
so that we are deprived of the usual in-
dications which enable his tragic quota-
tions to be fixed. There is a further
element of obscurity in schol. V's αντὶ
τοῦ εὐμενεστάτου, which Blaydes more
Suo desires to emend. It would not be
legitimate to deduce from this comment
that Sophocles wrote ’AaKXTjirioO παιῶνος
εὐμενεστάτου, and that Aristophanes for
his own purposes cut down his original.
We conclude that, though Aristophanes
may have abbreviated or adapted the
tragic text, he has not blurred or trans-
formed its essential features. It is fair
to add that from Pollux 2. 59 Κaὶ ἐξωμματῶσθαί
Φησιν Ἀριστοφάνης τὸν Πλοῦτον
ἐν Ἀσκληπιοῦ it might be argued that
ἐξομματοῦσθαι was not taken from Sopho-
cles. But that is purely negative evidence
which should not be allowed to displace
the positive considerations pointing the
other way.</p>
<p>That the general sense relates to the
healing of the Phineidae and not to that
of Phineus himself is proved by Phylar-
chus ap. Sext. Emp. math 1 262 (fr. 17

<p>2 ἐξωμμάτωται: so metaphorically in
Aesch. Prom. 514 Φλογωπὰ σήματα Ι
ἐξωμμάτωσα, πρόσθεν ὄντ' ἐπάργεμα
(where it should be observed that ἐπάργεμος
is a medical term: see fr. 233).
Philo I p. 455 Μ. καὶ τὸ

But a difficulty is imported from
Eur. fr. 541 ἡμεῖς δὲ Πολύβου παῖδ' ἐρείσαντες
πέδῳ Ι ἐξομματοῦμεν καὶ διόλλυμεν
κόρας, where ἐξομματοῦν = to deprive of
right. Hence several critics, from Byzantine
tine times onwards (see scholl.), have
supposed that Aristophanes intended to
direct attention to a ridiculous ambiguity
of language, holding that λελάμπρυνται
also covered a reference to the disease
λεύκωμα. This is quite unjustifiable; for
the usage of ἐκβροντᾶν, ἐκκηρύσσειν, ἐκμοχθεῖν,
ἐξαμιλλᾶσθαι, ἐξανθεῖν, ἐξεμπεδοῦν,
ἐξεπᾀδειν, ἐξοπλίζειν, ἐξοικεῖν, ἐξοινεῖν,
ἐξυγραίνειν (although it is not intended to
suggest that they all stand on the same
footing) shows that there was a tendency
for verbs compounded with ἐΚ to develope
a particular sense denoting expulsion by
the side of their ordinary meaning in
which the preposition bears a slightly in-
tensive force. — λελάμπρυνται: cf. Aesch.
Εum. 104 εὔδουσα γὰρ Φρὴν ὄμμασιν

<p>3 παιῶνος. παιών, as well as παιάν

246 I have pointed out that there is a
reference to Asclepius in Phil. 832. —
εὐμενοῦς is predicative in accordance with
a common idiom ; for the participle which
might have been expected (i.e. ὄντος here)
is often omitted. Cf. O.C. 1482 ἐνασίου

γ' ὡς καπηλείου θύραι' (Com. fr. adesp.
493, III 500 K.).</p>
<p>Several critics have perceived that
καπηλείου θύραι was substituted by the
parodist for the actual words of Sopho-
cles, and that the general sense of the
original was ‘ his eyes are closed as fast
as the gates of ’ Thus Gomperz
conjectured β. Κ. τἀνδρὸς ὡς Ἅιδου πύλαι,
and F. W. Schmidt β. κέκλῃταί γ' ὡς
ἀνήλιοι πύλαι Ι Ἅιδου. Better than these,
however, is the proposal of Crusius (see
cr. n.), which is derived from Zenob. 4.
86 (Paroem. 1 246) ἐς υνόσαργες, ἐς
ἀνηλίου πύλας: ἐκπὶ τῶν ὁμοίων Κaὶ τῦται,
i.e. ἐπὶ τῶν εἰς ἀδύνατα ἀνβαλλομενων.
Cf. Arsen. 200 εἰς Κυνόσαργες, εἰς ἀνηλίους
πύλας: εἴρηται ἐπὶ τῶν ὕβρει Κaὶ ἀραῖς
χρωμένων.</p>
<p>The point of the comparison would
then be that Hades is a warder who
never lets his prisoners escape : Theogn.
709 κυανέας τε πύλας παραμείψεται, αἴτε
θανόντων Ι Ψυχὰς εἴργουσιν καίπερ ἀναινομένας,
Prop. 4. 11. 2 panditur ad nullas
iatiiia nigra preces ; Ι cum semel infetnas
ijitrarunt funera leges, Ι non exorato stant
adamante viae. Hence the entrance is
firmly secured ([Plat.] Axioch. 371 B τὰ
δὲ πρόπυλα τῆς εἰς πλούτωνος ὁδοῦ σιδηροῖς
κλείθροις Καὶ κλεισὶν ὡχύρωται), and
the traveller who arrives must knock in
order to procure admission (Theocr. 2.
160). Note that Lucr. 5. 373 implies
that the gate of death was proverbially
kept closed. Nevertheless, admission
was readily granted : the counterpart of
Hades πυλάρτης is Hades πολυδέγμων,
πολύξενος (Aesch. Suppl. 163), πανδοκεύς
(Lycophr. 655) ; and it is rather in the
latter character that he resembles an inn-
keeper. Iambi, υit. Pyth. p. 196 τοὺς τὰ
μαθήματα καπηλεύοντας Καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς
ὡς πανδοχείου θύρας ἀνοίγοντας παντὶ τῷ

<pb n="319"/>
προσιόντι τῶν ἀνθρώπων. But the humour
of the parody depended chiefly on the
similarity of sound, and Sophocles can
hardly have written ὡς πολύξεοι πύλαι
after the pattern of O.C. 1570. The
parodist ludicrously substituted an open
for a shut door, although of course a be-
lated guest might arrive to find the tavern
closed : Ar. Lys. 426 ποῖ δ’ αὖ σὺ βλέπεις, Ι
οὐδὲν ποιῶν ἀλλ' ἢ κατηλεῖον σκοπῶν ;</p>

<p>It may be inferred with a high degree
of probability that these words are a
description of Phineus, as he appeared
to the Argonauts, in the state of ema-
ciation to which he was reduced by the
persecutions of the Harpies: cf. Apoll.

ceived this belongs to F. Jacobs (Addit.

quotes for the metaphor Sophron fr. 54 K.

no doubt prompted by a recollection of
Herod. 2. 86 — 90, and may therefore be
added to the list of cases where Sopho-
cles can be shown to have been influenced
by Herodotus : see on fr. 29. Moreover,
Herodotus uses the word τάριχος of a
corpse: 9. 120 (Protesilaus) καὶ

<p>We have already seen 1 that Welcker postulated an entirely
different argument for the Sophoclean Phoenix, and have given
reasons for rejecting his theory I It is in any case more probable
that Sophocles — whether he preceded or followed Euripides — in
selecting Phoenix for the title-rôle of a play, was occupied
with the pathetic history recounted in the ninth book of the
Iliad, than with an entirely subordinate incident in his later
life. Moreover, fr. 720 is naturally interpreted as a reference
to Phthia. The story as related by Homer comprised certain
primitive elements which Euripides avoided (schol. A Horn.
I 453 ἀναμάρτητον εἰσάγει τὸν ἥρωα ἐν τῷ ΦοίνιΚι); but it
would be rash to infer from τοῖς τραγικοῖς in schol. A Hom.
I 448 that Sophocles and Euripides were agreed. Nor can we
lay stress on the plural in Suid. s.u. ἐπηλυγάξονται. οἱ ὁ οἶν

κακὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπηλυγάξοντες, ἄλλως φασὶ τοῦτο
Epict. diss. I. 28. 32 probably refers to the Phoenix of Euripides;
but if wider scope were allowed to the mention of the tragic hero
as the victim of a false judgement, the allusion would be con-
sistent with the view which has been advocated above.</p>

ΦΡΙΞΟΣ
The story οf Phrixus has already been discussed in connexion
with the Athamas (l p. I), and any attempt to reconstruct the
plot of the Phrixus must take into account the results οἴ that
investigation. The internal evidence is insignificant, and general
probability can alone decide the issue. Urlichs conjectured that

<pb n="323"/>
the Phrixus related to the fortunes of the hero subsequent to his
arrival in Colchis. But ’s reply (p. 317) is
that the tradition records no adventure of Phrixus in that country
which could have formed the plot of a tragedy. Welcker himself
found the substance of the plot in Hygin. poet. astron. 2. 20 Crethea
autem habuisse Demodicen uxorem, quam alii Biadicen dixerunt
...hanc autem Phrixi, Athamantis filii, corpora inductam in amorem
incidisse: neque ab eo, ut sibi copiam faceret, impetrare
potuisse: itaque necessario coactam criminiari eum ad Crethea
coepisse, quod diceret, ab eo vim sibi paene adlatam, et horum
similia mulieruni consuetudine dixisse. quo facto Crethea, ut
uxoris amanteni et regent decebat, permotum ut de eo supplicium
sumeret persuasisse. Niibetn autem intervenisse et ereptum
Phrixum. . . irsum autem (i.e. Phrixus, after dedicating the fleece
of the ram at Colchis) a Mercurio ad Athamantem esse reductum
qui patri eius satisfecerit eutn innocentia confisum profugisse.
Another version made Demodice the step-mother of Phrixus,
and this, as I have endeavoured to show in Class. Reu. XXIII
255, is referred to by Pind. Pyth. 4. 161 δέρμα τε κριοῦ βαθύμαλλον
ἄγειν, Ι τῷ ποτ' ἐκ πόντου σαώθη Ι ἔκ τε ματρυιᾶς ἀθέων
βελέων. The scholiast οn Pindar comments as follows: ἐκακώθη
γὰρ διὰ τὴν μητρυιὰν ἐρασθεῖσαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπεβουλεύθη.
δὲ ὁ μὲν Πίνδαρος ἐν ὕμνοις Δημοδίκην, Ἱππίας δὲ Γοργῶπιν.
Σοφοκλῆς δὲ ἐν Ἀθάμαντι Νεφέλην. Φερεκύδης Θεμιστώ. Un-
fortunately, the scholiast, so far from elucidating the problem,
adds to the confusion by his statement that Sophocles in the
Athamas called the step-mother Nephele. This can hardly
be anything but a blunder, and was perhaps abbreviated from a
statement which made the union with Nephele subsequent to
the marriage with Ino. Such was in fact the account given
by Philostephanus (fr. 37, FHG III 34), who related that Nephele
left her husband, finding that he was still intriguing with Ino,
and that Ino was then restored to her former position. Escher
(in Pauly-Wissowa II 1931) preferred to explain that ’s
name is given as that of the prime contriver of the mischief,
i.e. of the sacrifice of Athamas. However that may be, the
statement of the scholiast does not in any way assist the con-
clusion that the Demodice-story was the central incident in the
Phrixus. ’s conjecture is thus little more than a guess,
but he is justified in remarking (P. 319) that Phrixus was
probably the leading character in the play which bears his
name, and that the proposed plot agrees well enough with that
assumption. There is however another possible solution which
must not be overlooked, viz. that the Phrixus contained the
earlier part of the story of I ’s plot up to the time of the
21—2


<pb n="324"/>
escape of the two children, whereas the Athamas, as has already
been suggested (l p. 2), narrated the subsequent punishment of
their father. On the other hand, Ahrens thought that the
Phrixus contained the concluding part of the story given by
Hyginus, that is to say, the return of Phrixus to his native
land and the establishment of his innocence.
Ribbeck (Röm. Trag. p. 526), who wrongly concludes
the story of Demodice was a late copy of that of Phaedra and
Hippolytus, and cannot therefore be attributed to Sophocles,
is driven to suggest that the Phrixus was a satyr-play.</p>

’s attempt to join ὅρια κελεύθου (as

combined notion, with the sense ‘via
recte ducens per regiones urbi finitimas ’
cannot be approved ; for the sense given
to bpia is improbable, and tragic usage
requires that it should be joined to γῆς
(Eur. Her. 82, Tro. 375). Hartung con-

hardly warranted in suspecting a corrup-
tion of the text. At the same time, it
must be admitted that it is not easy to
frame a context which will quite satis-
factorily account for κελεύθου. For the
completion of the sense something like
διὰ μακρᾶς περῶ seems to be demanded.
But in that case, unless there is a lacuna
in the quotation (e.g. ὅρια κελεύθου &#x003C; διὰ
μακρᾶς ἀξιγμένος Ι πάρειμ' Ἀχαιῶν &#x003E;

therefore seem impossible that it should

of this word: ι Frequentant recentiores

it maybe assumed that the  Antiatticist

that the word was current in Attic. One 
would suppose that it was employed in  
the sense which it usually bears in later 
Greek, that of simple, artless, naif; for, 
though no early instance of this meaning 
is quoted, it seems to be implied by the 
stylistic use, which appears in Aristotle

<p>Welcker1 had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that
the Phryges οf Sophocles was to be compared with the φρύγες ἢ
Ἕκτορος λύτρα of Aeschylus, and that the subject Οf both plays
was the visit made by Priam to the tent of Achilles in order to
ransom the body ΟΙ Hector, which is described in the last book
Οf the Iliad. He was to some extent influenced by schol. Aesch.

αὐθάδειαν, ὡς Ἀχιλλεὺς ἐν τοῖς φρυξὶ Σοφοκλέους: but the statement
in the Life Οf Aeschylus (Ρ. 3, 11=467, 25 W.), together
with Ar. Ran. 911 and the schol., prove that Menage was right
in regarding the mention of Sophocles as an error. When the
evidence for Sophocles’ play consisted of a single quotation,
there was some reason for Bergk’s opinion2 that the title should
be eliminated altogether; and Wecklein3 also conjectured that
fr. 724 ought to be assigned to Aeschylus. But the recent
discovery of a new fragment (725) alters the conditions of the
problem, although it is far from certain that the plot Οf Sophocles’
play was the same as that of its Aeschylean namesake4.</p>

Achilles and Polyxena, referring to ened in ἀνυμεναιοῦντες, for which see on
Hygin. fab. 110. no. According to some fr. 956 3. It is perhaps better to assume
authorities, a meeting was arranged be- that a word (e.g. ᾠδαῖς) has dropped out
tween Priam and Achilles to take place between γάμους and ἀνυμεναιοῦντες. The
in the grove of the Thymbraean Apollo verb ἀνυμεναιοῦν is otherwise unknown,
for the negotiation of the marriage; and but may be compared with ἀνυμνεῖν,
on that occasion Achilles was waylaid ἀνευφημεῖν, ἀναβοᾶν, ἀναχορεύειν, etc.</p>
<p>ΧΡΥΣΗΣ</p>
<p>Naeke (Opusc. 1 p. 91) was the first who perceived that the
plot of this play was to be found in Hygin. fab. 120, 121. After
relating the story of Orestes and Iphigenia according to the ver-
sion of Euripides in his Iphigenia in Tauris, the mythographer
adds (at the end oi fab. 120) that Iphigenia succeeded in carrying
off the image, and, setting sail with Orestes and Pylades, was
borne by a favourable wind to the island Sminthe, the home
of Chryses, priest of Apollo. The title Sminthius (Smintheus)
was especially connected with the worship of Apollo at Chrysa,
a town in the Troad (see on frs. 40, 384); but Strabo (605) de-
clared that it was to be found at several other places in the west
of Asia Minor, and in the islands off the coast. Whether by
’the island ’ is meant the island Chryse to the east of
Lemnos1 , and whether in any case the name is taken from
Sophocles we cannot tell. After referring to the events con-
nected with Chryses and Chryseis, as related in the first book
of the Iliad, Hyginus (fab. 121) proceeds with the sequel of
their history. When Agamemnon restored Chryseis, she was
already pregnant, but denied that she was with child by Aga-
memnon; and, after the birth of a son to whom also the name
of Chryses was given, declared that Apollo was his father. This
younger Chryses was grown to manhood at the time when Iphi-
genia, pursued by Thoas, arrived at the island. Thoas demanded
the surrender of the fugitives, and Chryses was disposed to comply
with the request, when his mother Chryseis 2, learning that Iphi-
genia and Orestes were the children of Agamemnon, divulged to

<pb n="328"/>
her son the true story of his birth. Thereupon Chryses assisted
his newly-found brother Orestes to kill Thoas, after which the
image of Artemis was safely conveyed to Mycenae.</p>
<p>Pacuvius also wrote a play with the title Chryses, which Naeke
supposed to be an adaptation of Sophocles. He is followed by
Welcker, Nauck, and Ribbeck; but Wilamowitz preferred to
suppose that Pacuvius made use of a post-Euripidean drama
dealing with the story of Iphigenia 1. In any case, the fragments
of Pacuvius would be but of little assistance for the elucidation
of Sophocles' plot; and the question is further complicated by
the doubt whether some of the most significant belong to the
Chryses or to some other play 2.</p>
<p>According to a tradition preserved in late authorities 3, the
name of Chryses was connected with the foundation of Chryso-
polis on the Bithynian coast of the Bosporus opposite to
Byzantium. After the death of Agamemnon Chryses fled from
the machinations of Clytaemnestra, and went in search of Iphi-
genia; but died at the place afterwards known as Chrysopolis,
where he was buried. Wilamowitz 4 believes that this legend
was adopted by Sophocles, and denies that the story recorded
by Hyginus can have been employed in the play. His reason
is to be found in the conviction that the plot of the Iphigenia
in Tauris was invented by Euripides, and cannot therefore have
been known to Sophocles at the time of the production of the
Chryses (before 414 B.C.5).</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that two, if not three 6, of the five
extant fragments appear to be comic in intention. This strongly
favours the inference that the Chryses was a satyr-play, and the
story of Hyginus was obviously capable of comic treatment.
On the other hand, not only did Pacuvius adapt Sophocles
elsewhere, but no other play than the Chryses is known which
could have served as the model of the Pacuvian tragedy.</p>
<p>Ο. Rossbach 7 referred to this play a mutilated papyrus
fragment published by Grenfell and Hunt in New Class. Frag-
ments II (Oxford, 1897), p. 3, which he restored as Ψευδῆ δὲ
Φοῖβος ἤγαγέν σε μαντέα, — an address of Agamemnon to Calchas
(Hom. A 106). This is a very remote possibility.</p>

2 Tr. Rom. Frag. 3 p. 143 off. ; see also Reid on Cic. Lael. 24. Ribbeck claims for
the Chryses, in preference to the Diilorestes, the famous scene in which Orestes and
Pylades disputed over their identity, in order that each might save the other from
imminent death. The conclusion is supported by Non. ς.υ. opino (Pacuv. loi R.).

<p>At every sacrifice the first offering, or
libation, was made to Hestia: Plat. Crat.
401 D τὸ πρὸ πάντων θεῶν τῇ Ἑστίᾳ πρώτῃ
προθύειν. There is good authority for the
statement that she was also honoured last,
but it is not clear whether this was the
case at every meal or only on the occasion
of a sacrifice: Horn. h. 29. 4 οὐ γὰρ ἄτερ
σοῦ | εἰλαπίναι θνητοισιν, ἴν᾿ οὐ πρώτῃ
πυμάτῃ τε | Ἑστίῃ ἀρχόμενος σπένδει μελιηδέα
οἶνον, Cornut. 28, Ρ. 53 Lang, kαθὸ
κἀν ταῖς θυσίαις οἱ Ἕλληνες ἀπὸ πρώτης τε
αὐτῆς ἡρχοντο Καὶ εἰς ἐσχάτην αὐτὴν κατέπαυον.
But the first offering is the more
frequently mentioned, so that ἀφ᾿ Ἑστίας
ἄρχεσθαι became proverbial for ‘to begin
at the beginnig,’ or ’to start’
(Plat. Crat. 401 B, Euthyphr. 3 A, Eur.
fr. 781, 35 Ἑστίας θ᾿ ἔδος, | ἀφ᾿ ἦς γε
σώφρων πᾶς ἂν ἄρχεσθαι θέλοι, Dio Chrys.
II. 56 ὕστερον ἡγανάκτουν ἐπὶ τοῖς πεπραγμένοις,
ἐξὸν ἀφ᾿ Ἑστίας κωλύειν). See
further Gruppe, Gr. Myth., p. 14054
Siiss in Pauly-Wissowa VIII 1272 ff. —
πρῷρα. The form of expression, which
strikes us as quaint, illustrates the pre-
valence of sea-faring metaphors at Athens
(ξυγόν, κλύδων, ΚατέΧειν, ὑφειμένος, οὕριος
etc.). Cf. Aesch. Suppl. 1000 ἐν πρύμνῃ
φρενός, Αg. 245 στόματος καλλιπρᾠρου.
In Eur. Tro. 103 μηδὲ προσίστω πρῷραν
βιότου Ι πρὸς κῦμα πλέουσα τύχαισιν I
think that βιοτου should be taken with
κῦμα rather than with πρῷραν, but the
figure is in any case remarkable. — For
κλώεις Papageorgius reads κλύοις; perhaps
rightly, since the line seems more likely to
be a prayer than an indignant question.
Ribbeck thinks that the mention of
Hestia suggests the identification of
Sminthe with Tenedos: see Pind. Nem.
II. Ι ff. Perhaps, he adds, the fugitives
took refuge at her altar. Welcker thought
the words were an exclamation by the
younger Chryses on learning the truth.</p>

<l>μακέλλῃ Ζηνὸς ἐξαναστραφῇ</l>
</lg>
<p>727 Schol. Ar. Αυ. 1240 τοῦτο Φησὶ
παρὰ τὸ Σοφόκλειον ἐν Χρύση (so Fritzsche
on Ar. Thesm. 300: χρυσῇ codd.) ‘μακέλλῃ
. . . ἐξαναστραφῇ.’</p>
<p>The words of Aristophanes (ὅπως μή
σου γένος πανώλεθρον | Διὸς μακέλλῃ πᾶν
ἀναστρέψῃ Δίκη) are an intentionally absurd
perversion of this passage, where
however we do not know what the subject
to ἐξαναστραφῇ was, and of Aesch.
Ag. 530 Τροίαν κατασκάψαντα τοῦ δικηφόρου
| Διὸς μακέλλῃ, τῇ κατείργαστι πέδον.
— μάκελλα, an agricultural implement,
which may best be rendered mattock and
probably resembled a pick rather than a
spade (Suid. Phot, glossed by δίκελλα
‘fork,’ schol. Aesch. σπάθῃ), was used
for breaking up the ground : Horn, Φ 259
Apoll. Rhod. 4. 1533. But the verb
points to the demolition of buildings:
cf. Aesch. Fers. 813 δαιμόνων θ᾿ ἱδρύματα
| πρόρριζα Φύρδην ἐξανέστραπται βάθρων.
— I have followed Nauck in accepting
Fritzsch’s ἐν Χρύσῃ. Dindorf (fr.
767) retains the vulg. χρυσῇ, but it is
not easy to explain the epithet. It is true
that the gods’ possessions are commonly
labelled as golden (cf. Ο. C. 1051 χρυσέα
κλᾐς, and epithets like χρυσήνιος and
χρυσηλάκατος); but it seems inept to
extend this fancy to μάκελλα. Ellendt
suggests alternatively that the thunderbolt
is meant: ‘fulmen coruscum cum
ligonis dentibus comparatum.’ But its
representations in art do not make it
likely that the Kepavvbs would have been
figured as μάκελλα.</p>

<l>τοιοῦτος ὢν ἄρξειε τοῦδε τοῦ κρέως</l>
</lg>
<p>728 ἄρξειε cod. Θ : ἄρξει RV, ἄρξεις Αld., ἄρξεις σὺ Brunck
728 Schol. Ar. Ran. 191 κρεῶν, ὡς
Ἀρίσταρχος Φησὶν ἐπὶ τῶν σωμάτων λαμβάνεσθαι
πολλάκις, Καὶ παρὰ τῷ Σοφοκλεῖ
ἐν Χρύσῃ ‘τοιοῦτος. . . κρέως.’</p>
<p>τοῦδε τοῦ κρέως is generally assumed
on the authority of Aristarchus to be a
periphrasis for the pronoun ἐμοῦ (or pos-
sibly ἐκείνου). The only extant parallels
are Ar. Εq. 421 ὦ δεξιώτατον κρέας, and
ib. 457 ὦ γεννικώτατον κρέας. Observe
however that the words may have borne
a stronger meaning ‘master of this my
’ But in neither case is it credible
that κρέας would have been used, if the
quotation was taken from a tragedy.
Outside the Cyclops, ρέας is only applied
to human flesh in reference to the banquet
of Thyestes. It is possible, therefore,
and perhaps not unlikely that the Chryses
was a satyric play. Brunck cut the knot
by reading ἐν Κρίσει, supposing that the
reference was to the promise of Helen to
Paris, and he was followed by Ellendt.
Welcker and Ribbeck assigned the speech
to a barbarian, Welcker to Chryses and
Ribbeck to Thoas ; but barbarians do not
speak so, unless they are represented as
comic characters. The parallel instances
οf σάρξ quoted by Welcker, and the peri-
phrastic use of σῶμα, δέμας, and Kapa
referred to by Blaydes do not solve the
difficulty. — In favour of Brunck's ἄρξεις
σύ, which he would make interrogative,
Blaydes quotes Ar. Eq. 1307 οὐ δῆτ' ἐμοῦ
γ' ἄρξει ποτ’, Lys. 631 ἀλλ' ἐμοῦ μὲν οὐ
τυραννεύσουσ', Eur. Ηer. 258 ἀλλ' οὐΚ
ἐμοῦ σὺ δεσπόσεις χαίρων ποτέ. This is
an attractive conjecture, but in such a
doubtful context we cannot condemn
ἄρξειε.</p>

17 de B. ἴονθος. ἡ ἐπὶ τοῦ προσώπου ἄμα

reascHi to doubt whether the tone is
serious, and this might bear on the in-
terpretation of fr. 728 Otherwise, there
is much to be said for lehrs's μέλαιναν.
Wagner's βίᾳ μέν is unintelligible. Bergk
(PLG III 711) retains τρίχας with μίαν
μέν, interpreting the latter as ‘ one by
one' like μίαν μίαν fr. 201. But τρίχας
is probably a mere blunder.</p>
