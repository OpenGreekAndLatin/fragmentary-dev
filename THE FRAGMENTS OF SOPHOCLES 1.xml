<head>PREFACE</head>
<p>THE production of this book has been delayed by various
causes, which require particular notice on the occasion of
its appearance. It is well known that Sir Richard Jebb intended
ultimately to include the Fragments in his edition of Sophocles;
and in pursuance of this intention he delivered at Cambridge
in the Michaelmas Term of 1895 a course of lectures on 132
ed fragments. The Ajax, the last to be published of the
seven extant plays, appeared in the autumn of 1896; and it was
anticipated that the publication of the Fragments would be
undertaken in due sequence. But the discovery of the Bacchylides
papyrus drew the editor's attention in another direction,
and, during the remainder of his life, the time which he could
spare from public duties was mainly devoted to the preparation
comprehensive edition of the Poems and Fragmej
which was published by the Cambridge University
in 1905. Thus it fell out that, when after Sir Richard
Jebb's death the task of completing the edition of Sophocles
devolved upon Dr Walter Headiam, the material available for
ise consisted solely of the notes prepared for the lectures
idy mentioned.</p>
<p>Once again misfortune attended the prosecution of the
schen nscquence of the premature death of Dr Headlam
re he was able to put into shape the preliminary labour
which for a number of months he had expended upon the
Towards the end of 1908 I was entrusted by the Syndics of the
University Press with the papers of both scholars, in order that
the work bo long deferred might be brought to a conclu
I will frankly admit that, though III of having assumed

<pb n="vi"/>
a serious burden, I did not at first adequately realize either the
magnitude or the difficulty of the task.</p>
<p>I am afraid that, after these preliminary remarks, readers
will be disappointed to find how small a share in the contents
of these volumes has been contributed by my predecessors
Headlam, according to his wont, set to work thoroughly to
explore the ground which he was preparing to develop, but hi
left very little evidence of the results at which he had arrived
and hardly anything in such a shape as could be adapted readily
for publication. Yet even the adversaria of so eminent a scholai
are of considerable interest, and not a few instances will be founc
where his insight has pointed out the way leading to the solutior
of a puzzling problem. ’s notes were of an entirely differen
character. Although well fitted to introduce to an undergraduate
audience the salient features of some of the most interesting
fragments, they were obviously unsuitable for reproduction as
containing the matured judgement of their author upon the
critical and exegetical questions which these fragments raise
They were chiefly the record of first impressions drawn up with
the skill and taste which we have learnt to expect from such a
source, but made without much exercise of independent research
or a full recognition of the departmental literature bearing upot
the subject, so far as it was at that time accessible. To have
printed any considerable portion of these notes would have been
both misleading and unfair. Indeed, I am doubtful if I have no
gone too far in including so much as will be found below; and
it is with the greatest reluctance that I have in several case
quoted ’s notes, where I felt bound to argue in favour of a
different conclusion. But my guiding principle has been this
The obscurity of the text of these fragments is so great, and so
little has been done to dispel it, that we can only hope to arrived
at the truth by a patient sifting of the clues suggested by com
petent authorities; and an editor may often best recommend the
solution which he considers probable by canvassing the views o(??)
other workers in the same field. Anyhow by this method the
reader is the better enabled to form his own judgement on the
issues submitted to him: securus indicat orbis terrarum.</p>
<p>It will now be apparent that not only the responsibility fo

<pb n="vii"/>
everything that appears in these volumes is entirely my own,
but also the bulk of the commentary itself 1. I must therefore
explain the lines upon which I have worked. The general plan,
modified only so far as was required by difference of subjectmetter,
was prescribed by the character of the earlier volumes,
and, although my predecessors had not advanced far in the
appointed track, they had at least made it plain that the chief
feature of the book should be a thorough and searching exegesis.
Translation was less essential than in the complete plays and
often impossible; but in some of the longer fragments I am
fortunate in being able to quote renderings made by Jebb and
Headlam. In the elucidation of fragmentary and corrupt texts
criticism and interpretation are complementary of each other.
I have therefore endeavoured to present the critical data in as
accurate a form as possible, taking Nauck’s edition as my basis,
and verifying, supplementing, and correcting its results so far as
my opportunities permitted. It has not been possible for me to
obtain unpublished information concerning the readings of the
f authors which have not been edited in accordance with
the requirements of modern criticism; but I have endeavoured
to make myself acquainted with published results, although
I cannot feel confident of having surveyed every part of so
a field. In this respect not much has been done since the
ranee of Nauck’s second edition. It is true that editions
and Plutarch’s Moralia, two of our most important
es, have been completed by Hense and Bernardakis. But
’s results had been already communicated to Nauck. and
the character of Bernarkakis's edition is such that it is almost
entirely useless for the present purpose. Our knowledge of the
Boost important scholia is still imperfect, although progress has
been made, especially in regard to Aristophanes and Pindar.
WeodeTs edition of the scholia to Theocritus appeared while
passing through the press. Much might be learnt
from a critical edition of KiMathius, which is scarcely to be
at present But the lexicographers are the moat

writings.</note>

promising field of all, and, though a good deal of work has
been done in sifting their records, very little of it has seen the
light. Bethe's Pollux and de Stefani's Etymologicum Gudiannum
are both incomplete. Here too the recovery of fresh material
from unedited sources which may be still preserved in the libraries
of Europe has been shown to be more than a possibility by the
labours of Reitzenstein, Rabe, and others.</p>
<p>The actual increase of material that has accrued in the last
twenty-five years is not completely measured by the fact that
this edition contains almost exactly ioo more fragments than
were published by Nauck. A considerable proportion of the
accession comes from the recently discovered commencement
of Photius, published by Reitzenstein in 1907. But the most
important addition of all was of course the fragments of the
Ichneutae and Eurypylus contained in the ninth volume of the
Oxyrhynchus Papyri. The discovery was made at a time when
the greater part of the present commentary was written, and
I am glad to be able now to express my thanks to Prof. A. S. Hunt,
who was kind enough to allow me to inspect the sheets of the
new fragments before publication, and has more than once replied
to my queries concerning the actual readings of the MS in
doubtful cases. I must also acknowledge my indebtedness to
the Committee of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Delegates
of the Clarendon Press for permission to include the Oxyrhynchus
fragments in the pages of this edition.</p>
<p>In the General Introduction I have endeavoured to describe
the literary history of Sophoclean tragedy, to estimate the extent
and variety of its activity, to discover the vestiges of the material
with which it worked, and to show how its monuments were
transmitted to posterity until they passed into oblivion and how
finally its scanty relics were preserved for the instruction of our
own times. In this way I have tried to answer the questions,
why the majority of the plays were lost, and by what means
their fragments survived. It will be evident that the third
section follows in the main the lines which have been sketched
in various writings by Prof, von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. In
dealing with the sources of our existing fragments I have entered
at some length into the history of Greek philological literature

<pb n="ix"/>
during the Roman and Byzantine ages, confining myself particularly
to its connexion with the study of Sophocles. This is
an arid region; yet I am convinced that those who make themselves
acquainted with its chief features will return not only with
a clearer understanding of the limits within which the criticism
of the Greek poets must proceed, but also with a deeper respect
for the honest labours of generations of workers who struggled
against the forces of barbarism to keep alive the purity of the
c· speech. So much misconception prevails as to the
of quotations made by these writers that no apology is
needed for the space which has been devoted to them. The
only work of reference in English which touches this branch of
literature is Sir J. E. Sandys's History of Classical Scholarship.</p>
<p>Shortly after the printing had commenced, it was decided to
advantage of the occasion by the preparation of a comprehensive
index to the whole of the ten volumes. For this purpose
Prof. Jebb's seven volumes have been carefully re-read, the old
indexes have been consolidated, corrected, and considerably
enlarged, and the entries so collected have been incorpo:
with those relating to the three volumes of Fragments. The
work was at first undertaken by Mr G. V. Carey of Gonville and
Caius College, who re-indexed the Ajax and Antigone; but, W hen
he obtained a commission in the Army on the outbreak of the
European War, the responsibility for the remaining portions
passed into my hands. It is hoped that the new indexes will
tudentfl not only as a better means of accc
the information which the volumes contain, but also as a n
of Sophoclean usage for anyone who may attempt further rephere
of tragic vocabulary and grammar. At
ame time their users should be warned what they do not
anything more than a record of the mat(??)
comprised in the commentaries; for an attempt to provide by
of the language would have
I an enormous addition to a labour which h already
ly arduous.</p>
<p>I have elsewhei ised and tabulated the researches of
modern scholars irho since the close of the eight
century have laboured directly on the fragments of Sophocles,

<pb n="x"/>
and it is unnecessary to repeat here the nature of my obligations
to them. Most of this literature is scattered in various periodicals
or contained in dissertations which are even more difficult of access.
In this connexion my thanks are due to Prof. R. Reitzenstein Of
Freiburg for supplying me with information respecting the contents
of one of his dissertations which I had been unable to
procure. Nor must I forget to mention the singular kindness of
the late Dr Siegfried Mekler of Vienna, the editor of Dindorf's
Sophocles in the Teubner series, who, hearing that I was engaged
on this work, sent me a number of notes bearing on various
points of difficulty. This will explain the occasional references
to Mekler's unpublished views. Dr J. B. Pearson and Mr R. D.
Hicks have kindly permitted me to print extracts from certain
notes formerly communicated to Prof. Jebb in reference to
frs. 776 and 1128. Notwithstanding the considerable output
of labour directed to the criticism of the fragments, the attention
which they have received is scanty in comparison with the
mass of comment which has accumulated upon the extant
plays. Hence I have been often compelled to rely largely on
my own resources. This is, in fact, the first systematic effort that
has been made to put together a continuous commentary, though
I have the best of reasons for knowing that its imperfections
are not due to that cause alone. I must warn readers that the
printing of the book was seriously delayed by the stress of
recent events and that it went to the press at the beginning of
1913. Everyone knows the difficulties and inconsistencies that
are apt to occur in such cases, and that they cannot be satisfactorily
cured by the list of corrigenda.</p>
<p>I desire to acknowledge the generous support which I have
throughout received from the Syndics of the Cambridge University
Press, although the work has grown to a size which neither
they nor I contemplated at the time of its inception.</p>

<p>§ 1. The number of the plays.</p>
<p>The anonymous Life of Sophocles1 records on the authority <note type="marginal">External evidence.</note>
Aristophanes of Byzantium that 130 2 plays were attributed3
Sophocles, but that 17 of these were spurious. The state-
t is entitled to credit, as coming from Aristophanes; and it
n referred with high probability to his work entitled πρὸς
ς Καλλιμάχου πίνακας 4. Not much is known of the book in
tion, but it may be taken to have contained corrections and
enlargements of the well-known irivaKes of Callimachus, which
not merely a catalogue of the books contained in the
irian library, but included biographical details concernthe
various authors, and in the case of the Attic drama the
dates of the production of the several plays, as well as other
of interest drawn from the SiSaaicaXiai of Aristotle5.</p>
<p>Suidas, however, reports that Sophocles produced 123 plays
and according to some authorities considerably more. This
rmation may be reconciled with the Life in two

substitution of for 17 (ζ΄ for ιζ΄) in the Life. The latter
proposal is palaeographically the easier, and the number 123
agrees better than 113 with the remaining data, as will presently
appear.</p>
<note type="marginal">Number of victories.</note> <p>The number ΟΙ his victories is also variously recorded.
According to Suidas, they were twenty-four; according to the
Life, which followed the authority of Caristius of Pergamum1,
twenty; and, according to Diodorus, only2 eighteen. The lastmentioned 
statement is now confirmed by the evidence of a
recently discovered inscription3. Further, we are informed by
the Life4 that, in addition to the twenty victories, he several
times gained the second prize, but never the third. Cratinus5
intimates that on one occasion at least Sophocles was refused a
chorus altogether; but, even if the statement is literally correct,
it is impossible to determine whether the plays written for that
occasion were or were not included in the total number assigned
to Sophocles by Aristophanes. It is conceivable, though not
very probable, that the number of victories recorded by Suidas
included occasions on which Sophocles received the second
prize6. Others have thought that the inclusion of Lenaean
victories is the cause of the discrepancy ; and a parallel has
been found in the case of Cratinus, who, though credited with
only three victories at the Lenaea in the inscription already
quoted, reaches the total attributed to him by Suidas by means
of six others gained at the City festival7. This view is sufficiently
plausible, and it would perhaps be unnecessary to look further,
if it were not for the comparative unimportance of the Lenaea

<note type="footnote">7 The explanation was first put forward by Bergk in Rh Mus. XXXIV ,298 It is
accepted by Haigh, Attic Theatre3, pp. 28, 46; but by a curious slip the number of
the victories won by Cratinus at the two festivals is inverted. The text is thus at
variance with the inscriptions quoted on pp. 363, 364. See also Wilhelm, Urkunden,
p. 106.</note>

in the history of tragedy 1. At the same time, where numerals
are concerned, we must not neglect their constant liability to
suffer corruption 2. However this may be, eighteen victories at
the City Dionysia, where tetralogies were always produced.
involved the performance of seventy-two plays. Of the remaining
fifty-one in the Alexandrian list, it is reasonable to suppose,
even when we bear in mind ’ extraordinary popularity,
that at least nine tetralogies — if not more — consisted of
which obtained the second prize. The calculation leaves little
room for exhibition at the Lenaea, so that, if performances at
that festival are used to account for the twenty-four victories
mentioned by Suidas, it would follow that the titles of many
of the plays which Sophocles produced were unknown to the
mdrians.</p>
<p>Objection has been taken 3 to the number 123 on the ground
that it cannot be divided into tetralogies. But several explana-
are possible. Thus, since the evidence concerning the
Lena- to establish the fact that tragedies were produced
in groups of three rather than of four, the inclusion of such
plays might account for the odd number. Or, again, since
that the Oedipus Coloneus was not produced until after
the death of its author, it is possible, as Dindorf suggested 4
that he left only three plays ready to be included in his thirtyfirst
tetralogy, and that Sophocles the younger added the fourth.
Further, it is almost certain that the Archelaus and Andromache
uripides 5 were not included in the official lists of tetralogies
διδασκαλίαι); and it is quite possible that similar exceptions
known to exist among the authentic works of Sophocles.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 For the fifth century we have no evidence except the record of ’t victory
(??) cf. Plat. Symp. 173 A), and the in 1 19 and 418
From the latter it is inferred that each poet submitted three plays.

<pb n="xvi"/>
<note type="marginal">Early loss of plays.</note> <p>In the next place, it will be observed that, whereas in the
case of Euripides we have a definite statement that 78 plays outl
of a total number of 92 were extant at Alexandria 1, no similar
information is available in relation to Sophocles. Yet the
general probabilities of the case, as well as the analogy of
the history of the other tragedians, forbid us to believe that
Aristophanes had access to copies of all the plays whose titles
were taken into account in his calculation of the total. The
conclusion is assisted by the fact that losses of certain dramas
are actually recorded in some of the extant Arguments 2. Elmsley
has shown 3 that satyr-plays in particular often failed to survive,
so that their existence was only known from their appearance
in the διδασκαλίαι: whether his criticism is applicable to the
Sophoclean tradition will be considered later.</p>
<note type="marginal">Numbers assigned to certain plays.</note> <p>A further question arises in regard to the puzzling statement
in the Argument to the Antigone, that the play is reckoned as
the thirty-second 4. The figures recorded for the Alcestis, the
Aves, the Dionysalexandros of Cratinus, and the Imbrians of
Menander, 17, 35, 8 and some figure between 71 and 79 respectively,
require examination in the same connexion 5; but
for the present purpose we must confine ourselves to the
Antigone. The extant Aeschylean catalogue suggests that the
figure might refer to the alphabetical order, and some critics
have inclined to this view 6. Inasmuch, however, as some twentythree
titles beginning with A are known, in order to satisfy an
alphabetical arrangement we should be obliged to assume that
at least nine others were lost, and to place the Antigone last in

<note type="footnote">5 There is a discussion of the whole subject by R. C. Flickinger in Class. Phil.
V 1—18. But the data have since been enlarged by the publication of Oxyr. Pap.

the Imbrians was numbered εβδομηκοστ[ην και . . . .</note>

<pb n="xvii"/>
order or nearly so. The improbability of the double assumption
is so great that we must look elsewhere for an explanation of
the numeral. But the chronological solution is also open to
objections of considerable weight. As the plays were produced
in tetralogies, it is strange that the Antigone rather than a satyrplay
should have been reckoned as the last play of the eighth
tetralogy 1. Further, if Sophocles only produced thirty-two plays
in the first twenty-seven (or twenty-six) years of his dramatic
career, it is surprising that he should have written as many as
ninety-one in the last thirty-five (or thirty-six). However, the
latter argument is not entirely convincing, since several reasons
are conceivable which might favour an increased productivity
in the poet's later life. Flickinger, who has made the most
recent examination of the problem presented by these dramatic
us to be justified in concluding that their original
function was to record the arrangement of the volumes in some
library. — presumably the Alexandrian. If each play of which
the library possessed a copy was distinguished by a numeral, it
is unlikely that their arrangement was arbitrary rather than
ling to some rational system. For the purpose supposed
a chronological basis becomes the more probable, since se
of the early plays may have been lost; but we should still be
1 to infer that Sophocles increased the rate of his
output subsequently to the date of the Antigone 2. It should
Ided that the recently discovered evidence respecting the
ins of Mcnander entirely confirms this conclusion. An
alphabetical al solution is absolutely excluded by the remaining
and moreover, since the roll to which the fragment
belonged seems to have contained an alphabetical series of
the fact that the numerical order of the plays
recorded clearly points to some other principle

of arrangement. On the other hand, although the date of the
Imbrians may be open to argument 1, the chronological solution
would not involve any serious difficulty.</p>
<note type="marginal">Number of extant titles.</note> <p>Now that we have examined the external evidence bearing
on the number of the plays, we must enquire how far the numbei
of titles actually known to us from quotations corresponds with
the total of 123 plays said to have been recorded by Aristophanes,
The number of actual or ostensible titles of which we have
information, including those of the seven surviving plays, is al
least 132, but there is hardly any doubt that this total must be
reduced for the purpose of ascertaining the correct number oi
the plays which the titles represent. Five certain cases ol
double titles have been counted as single plays in the reckoning
adopted above, i.e. Ἀτρεὺς ἢ Μυκηναῖαι, Μάντεις ἢ Πολύιδος,
Ναυσικάα ἢ Πλύντριαι, Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀκανθοπλὴξ ἢ Νίπτρα, Πανδώρα
ἢ Σφυροκόποι. These double titles were chiefly, if not
entirely, a device adopted by the grammarians in order to distinguish
plays bearing the same title but written by different
authors 2. It will be observed that in each case, except Ὀδυσσεὺς
ἀκανθοπλὴξ ἢ Νίπτρα, the name of a leading character is
combined with a name taken from the chorus; and in view oi
the prevalence of the latter among the titles of Aeschylus, it
may be conjectured that the chorus-names Μυκηναῖναι, Μάντεις,
Πλύντριαι, and Σφυροκόποι, were the original designations chosen
by Sophocles. It sometimes happens that this practice of the
grammarians, instead of tending to precision, is actually a source
of confusion, when quotations are made by means of one or the
other of the alternative titles, so that, unless there is independent
evidence of the combination, two different plays appear to be
cited. Thus it is highly probable that the Αἰθίοπες should be
identified with the Μέμνο,ν (i p. 22), the Κάμικοι with the Μίνως
(II p. 4), and the Ἡρακλῆς (but not the Ἠρακλεΐσκος) with the
ἐπὶ Ταινάρῳ σάτυροι (i p. 167). The probable identity of the
Ἐπίγονοι with the Ἐριφύλη (I p. 129) only differs in so far as
Ἐπίγονοι is not a name given to the chorus, but serves, like
Ἑπτὰ ἐπὶ Θήβας, as a succinct description of the subject-matter,

of the Δόλοπες with the Φοῖνιξ (I p. 120), of the second
Φινεύς with the Τυμπανισταί (II p. 3 1 3f.), and of the Φθιώτιδες
with the ’Epfiioprj (11 p. 306), are much more disputable. A still
more frequent source of error was the substitution for the true
title of the name of one of the principal characters; but, though
scholars seem sometimes tacitly to approve such combinations
as Οἰνόμαος ἢ Ἱπποδάμεια 1, they are not really instances of
double titles deliberately adopted by author or critic, but the
results of lapse of memory, carelessness of citation, or confusion
by a copyist. The matter is of so much importance not
merely to the present investigation, but also to the arrangement
and interpretation of the Fragments themselves, that we must
stablish beyond the possibility of dispute that such errors
are not infrequent. Now, the Orestes of Euripides is sometimes
entitled Electra in late MSS (see e.g. C.R. II 172), just as conversely
Longinus περὶ εὑρέσεως (Walz, Rhet. Gr. IX 589) refers
to El. 11 22 as spoken by Electra in the Orestes. Similarly, the
nissae appears as the Oedipus (C.R. II 172), the Baccliae as
entheus 2, the Hippolytus as the Phaedra 3, and the Troades
as the Hecuba 4. Hence we are not surprised to find that the
maus us is cited once as the Hippodamia 5, the Daedalus once
as the Talos 6, the Heracles once as the Cerberus 7, and the Tyro
Pelias 8. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that Ion wtm an alternative title for the Creusa (11 P. 23), and
Clytaemnestra either for the Iphigenia the Aegisthus (1 P. 219);
but hesitation is pardonable before we accept the identification
of the Theseus with the Phaedra (or the Aegeus: 1 p. 184), of
the Acrisius with the Danae (1 p. 38), of the Aletes with the
me 11 p. 173). of the Andromache with the Pastores (1 p. 78),
reus with the Aides (II p. 268) It happens
ionally, though much less frequently, that a play is cited
by the name not of a character, but of a person who is described

or referred to by one or more of the speakers. We do not know
enough about the Licymnius of Euripides to feel sure that the
misquotation of fr. 472 in Bachm. anecd. I p. 412, 7 as coming
from the Heracles is an error of this kind; but there can be no
doubt in regard to schol. Plat. rep. 361 B, where Aesch. Theb.
579 ff. are cited as Αἰσχύλου ἐξ Ἀμφιαράου. A similar example
is probably to be found in Soph. fr. 731, where, following
Hartung, I have suggested that ἐν Ἰνάμβῃ covers a reference to
the Triptoletnus, and the mysterious title Ξοανηφόροι (fr. 452)
may perhaps be explained as an allusion to a particular scene
in the Laocoon. An error more easily detected is the ascription
(of a play to the wrong author, that is to say, to Aeschylus or
Euripides instead of to Sophocles, or to Sophocles instead of to
Aeschylus or Euripides. In the result there may be occasional
difficulties respecting the genuineness of individual fragments 1
but the discovery of the mistake seldom effects the removal of a
title from one tragedian to another. Relying on the existence
of this source of error, scholars have refused to credit the statement
that Sophocles wrote a Prometheus 2; and similarly Welcker
conjectured that the titles Ixion and Sisyphus belonged exclusively
to Aeschylus and Euripides 3. Important additions to
the text of Sophocles, which result from the recognition of an
error in the statement of authorship, will be found in frs. 581
and 684. Another cause of disturbance is the doubt which
exists as to the number of plays corresponding to the titles
Atreus and Thyestes, and Phineus and Tympanistae; and it is
uncertain whether the titles Ἑλένη, Ἑλένης ἀπαίτησις, and
Ἑλένης ἀρπαγή, imply the existence of three, two, or only
one play.</p>

the Alexandrian epoch; and even of it we can only say that
there is no positive indication of its survival. It has already
been remarked that we have no record of the number of
hoclean plays which were preserved in the Alexandrian
library. Now, if ’s hypothesis 2 were correct, it would
w that we are still able to trace practically all the genuine
plays as having passed into the keeping of the Alexandrians.
But it is in the highest degree improbable that copies of every
one of them survived throughout the interval between the fifth
and third centuries. On the other hand, if we accept 123 as the
actual total of the genuine titles, we are now in a position to say
that some 1 οἱ of the plays to which they belonged were known

there are very few indeed 3 of which Alexandria has left us no

at least belonged to the same category as the Alcestis, so tl
they might have served as substitute tyr-plays in the last

reasons given in the Introductory Note. Satyr-plays were not
produced at the Lenaea; but even if we make a liberal allowance
for the inclusion in the list ΟΙ plays performed at this festival, it
seems clear that several satyr-plays were lost before the time οf
Aristophanes. This is no more than might have been expected,
in view of the scantiness of the information concerning them
which we owe to the Alexandrians2.</p>
<p>§ 2. The The subjects of the plays.</p>
<note type="marginal">Classification of subjects.</note> <p>The subjects chosen by Sophocles for the composition of his
piays were taken exclusively from ancient legends. When we
seek to analyse and arrange them, various methods of classification 
are possible. Thus the locality to which each particular
story belonged might be adopted as the guiding principle οf
division; and such a course would be justified, if the dramatic
stories rested chiefly upon oral tradition, gathered directly οr
indirectly from different quarters of the Hellenic world. But,
except incidentally or when belonging to Attica itself, the
material of tragedy is not drawn from myths of merely local
circulation. It was shaped from the κλέα ἀνδρῶν which rhapsodes 
had sung from time immemorial throughout the length
and breadth of Greece—καθ᾿ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος. Not
that local associations are entirely to be neglected: the dramas
whose scenes were laid in Attica, Boeotia, or Aetolia, tend to be
grouped together, even where some other link has been chosen
for their connexion. Genealogical affinity is a more promising
point of departure. Every noble family could trace its descent,

dy to Sparta, and from Elis to Orchomenus. It would
be easy, with the information at our command, to distribute
among the chief houses the tales of the sufferings and achievements
s of their successive representatives. To this aspect of the
matter we shall presently return. But the mythical p
not merely treasured in family chronicles; it supplied the record
of the glorious beginnings of Greek history. Pelops line was
linked indissolubly with ’the tale of Troy divine.' The orderly
disposition of the early saga, which preserved it as the common
heritage of later ages, was mainly the work of the epic poets.
to Sophocles the legends of Hellas were permanently embedded
in its poetry; and the task of cataloguing his plays will only be
adequately performed, in so far as we succeed in discovering
their literary sources.</p>
<p>Although the data available for the reconstruction of the <note type="marginal">influence of Homer.</note>
lamentably scanty, we are generally in a position
ze the chief features of the stories which Sophocles

testimony of Zoilus, the speaker in Athenaeus 1, that ’Sophocles
blighted in the epic Cycle to such an extent that throughout

the Academic took an equal pleasure in Homer and in Sophocles,
declaring that Homer was an epic Sophocles, Sophocles a tragic
Home 1. It was chiefly in respect of his diction that Sophocles
was called ’the most Homeric of Attic poets; but his most
intimate point of contact with the Homeric spirit was his refusal
to employ his art for the purpose of fostering religious enthusiasm,
of promoting a purer morality, or of freeing the mind
from conventional shackles, while he laboured to create afresh
the heroic figures of ancient legend, and to present under new
conditions the majesty of the life which Homer had first
portrayed.</p>
<p>The Homeric element in Sophocles' style is easily recognizble,
but the evidence which establishes his close adherence to
Homeric models must not be taken to imply that, as a dramatic
poet, he was deficient in inventive power. We infer simply
that, in erecting the framework of his plays, Sophocles selected
Homeric material to a larger extent than his fellow tragedians.
For this purpose no distinction need be drawn between ῾Homer᾿
<note type="marginal">The Epic Cycle.</note> and the poems of the epic Cycle. Down to about 500 Β. C.
no doubt had arisen that the latter were actually written by
Homer 2, and the popular conception remained unshaken until,
a much later date. When Aeschylus said that his tragedies
were slices from ’s ample feast 3, it is beyond question that
he was not referring to the Iliad and Odyssey alone. Indeed, it
is extremely unlikely that the phrase ’epic Cycle' or even
notion which it expressed had come into existence during the
lifetime of Sophocles 4. What then precisely was the epic Cycle?
The answer is given by certain extracts from the direstomatJiia
of Proclus the Neoplatonist 5, which are preserved partly in the.

same field is asserted in Isocr. 12. 263, and the transferred sense of κυκλικός at Alexandria

bibliotheca of the patriarch Photius (f. 318 B 21) and partly in
f Homer, i.e. chiefly in Ven. A supplemented by the
Escurial and other less well known copies. What is called the
epic Cycle commenced, according to Proclus, with the fabled
union of Uranus and Gaia, and contained all the myths relating
to the gods as well as such historical facts as emerged in the
course of the description. It was the work of various poets, and
came to an end with the landing of Odysseus on the coast of
Ithaca, when his son Telegonus unwittingly slew him. Proclus
adds that the preservation and currency of the epic Cycle were
to be ascribed not so much to its merit as to the orderly
sequence of events which it contained τὴν ἀκολουθίαν τῶν ἐν
αὐτῷ πραγμάτων). The later extracts, which are on a larger
scale, relate to the subject-matter of the Cycle, and comprise
what purports to be an abstract, beginning with the Cypria and
ending with the Telegony, of six epics covering the period of
the Trojan war. The character of Proclus's evidence and the
value to be attributed to it were materially affected by the
very of its affinity to the mythographical handbook which,
h known as the bibliotheca of Apollodorus, was certainly not
the work of the famous grammarian of the second century B.C.

language with Proclus's epitome of the six Cyclic epics that
there can be no hesitation in attributing to them a common
origin. The inference is drawn that there lay at the basis of
the mythographical compendium which was produced, whether
by Dionysius the Cyclograph 1 or another, in late Alexandrian
times, and was the common source of the extant mythographical
literature, a composition known as the ῾cycle of the events
described by the epic ’ κύκλος ὑπὸ τῶν ἐποποιῶν ἱστορημένος).
From the inclusion of their works in this cycle the
term Cyclic was transferred from the handbook to the poems
themselves 2. The Alexandrian Κύκλος was not intended to serve
a literary purpose, that is to say, the provision for readers of
the old epics of detailed information about them, but rather to
supply people of ordinary education with a succinct digest of
mythical history based upon the writings of the ancient poets.
Proclus indicates that the poems themselves were valued chiefly
as authoritative records of the events which they described 3.
We should not therefore be surprised if the ostensible epitome,
particularly in the form in which it has come down to us, is
found to contain some elements foreign to the original sources,
or even at variance with the other vestiges of our fragmentary
knowledge concerning them 4. Now, it will be observed that,

refers to Dionysius Scytobrachion, the writer (among other works) of a ’romance’
Argonautica who is frequently cited by Diodorus and the scholia on Apollonius, and
is sometimes confused (e.g. by Christ-Schmid, op. cit. p. 93) with Dionysius the
Cyclograph. See Susemihl, 11 45, 57; E. Schwartz in Pauly-Wissowa V 928, 932.

although we have in Proclus a complete summary of the tale of
Troy, we know nothing whatever about the epics from which
the beginning of the cycle was made up. The analysis of the
poems which covered the period stretching from the marriage
of Uranus and Gaia to the opening of the Cypria is entirely lost.
It is unfortunate that the gap cannot be filled up with material
prawn from other quarters: for even though we might learn but
little of their distinctive versions, it would be instructive to
discover the names of those poems which Alexandrian Scholarship
regarded as the most authoritative documents concerning
the early myths. The reference in Athenaeus to ’
fondness for the epic Cycle follows immediately upon a quotation
from the Titanomachia, which suggests that that poem was
included in the Cycle. But the first place in order of time is
claimed for a Cyclic Theogony, which is to be distinguished
pom 1 Hesiod's work of the same name 1. The only other poems
which by general consent are assigned to the epic Cycle are the
Thebais 2, sequel the Epigoni, and its precursor the Oedipodea.
The relation of the Ἀμφιάρεω ἐξέλασις to the other Theban
dently to the Cycle, is quite uncertain 3. The

nd moat important part of the Cycle, but it rests upon
no other evidence than the accidental preservation of ’roclus’s
act. The Ionian epos, it is true, culminated in the Τρω

Cinaethon, and Asius; and these, as well as the anonymous
Phoronis, Alcmaeonis, and Naupactia, must have exercised some
influence upon Sophocles and the other tragedians. We may
add the Aegimius, which is sometimes ascribed to Hesiod; but
in their bearing upon Attic tragedy the most important of the
Hesiodic poems was the γυναικῶν κατάλογος.</p>
<note type="marginal">Classification of myths.</note> <p>it appears from this discussion that, except in the case of the
Trojan epics, and of these only in so far as we can rely on the
statements of Proclus, it is impossible to make a list of ῾Sophocles᾿
literary sources so as to map out under each the plays whose
plots are derived from them. The alternative has been adopted
of arranging the plays according to the ῾sequence of ’

pseudo-Apollodorus. It is true that this does not rest either
directly or at all upon a series of abstracts or arguments

follow particular tragic authorities, it merely reflects the influence
of tragedy upon the current conception of mythical history 1.
But the general outline which it presents corresponds in the
main with the order in sequence of the myths as it was apprehended
in the fifth century; and the genealogical framework by
which the various episodes were held together must ultimately
be traced to the influence of Hecataeus, of Acusilaus, and above
all of Pherecydes of Leros, the somewhat older contemporary of
Sophocles. The genealogies, again, though fixed and distributed
by these chroniclers, were derived by them from early heroic

second). Cretheus, the husband of Tyro, was also the father of
Pheres and Aeson, so that we may add (d) the doubtful plays
Admetus1 and Eumelus; and (e) the series of plays containing
various episodes of the Argonautic adventure: Lemniae, Amycus,
Phincus (first and second), Tympatiistac, Colchides, Scythae, and
mi. The Argonautic saga comes next to the Trojan in
variety and extent; but, though there are several allusions to
the Argonauts and their adventures in Homer, and many more
siod, none of the Hesiodic poems, unless it be the third
book of κατάλογος 2, appears to have contained a complete
narrative of the voyage. Of later epics the Naitpactia, and the
Corinthiaca of Eumelus, clearly related to this subject.</p>

in a Dorian epic which disappeared at a very early date and;
consequently exercised no direct influence on Attic tragedy 1.
’s slighting reference 2 shows that the poems which
existed in his time were not of much account. An exception
should perhaps be made in favour of the Οἰχαλίας ἅλωσις, one
of the chief sources of the Trachiniae, which was attributed to
the Ionian Creophylus 8. ὁ) Europa, the daughter of Agenor,
became the mother of Minos, with whose story are connected;
the plays Daedalus, Camici, Minos 4, and Polyidus Μάντεις).
Cadmus, the brother of Europa, whose journey in search of his
sister brought him ultimately to Thebes, was the traditional
ancestor of the Theban dynasty. The following plays are:
connected with the fortunes of his descendants: Dionysiscus,
Niobe, Oedipus Tyrannus, Oedipus Coloneus, Ampliiaraus, Antigone,
Epigoni (or Eriphyle), Oecles, and Alcmaeon. The Theban
epics have already been mentioned.</p>
<p>IV. Pelasgus, according to some the son of Zeus and Niobe,
but by others reckoned as sprung from the soil, stands at the
head of the Arcadian genealogies. The Arcadian plays are the
Aleadae, Telephus, and Mysi.</p>
<p>V. Arcadia was also the scene of the Ichneutae, which
however occupies a separate class in view of its relation to the
fortunes of Maia, daughter of Atlas the Titan.</p>
<p>VI. The Asopids. We are here concerned with the adventures
of the descendants of Aeacus, the grandson of Asopus. The

there is much doubt respecting the subjects of the Peleus,
Phthiotides, Dolopes, and Phoenix.</p>
<p>VII. Cecrops the earth-born was the earliest figure in the
mythical sequence of the Athenian kings. The Attic legends
were favourite subjects with Sophocles and Euripides, and here

much as to literary models. No doubt the outlines of the chief
stories had been fixed by previous writers, but we know scarcely

Coloneus, which in form belongs to the Theban Cycle, is largely
Attic in substance, and entirely in spirit.</p>
<p>VIII. The Tantalids. Here, as in the case of the Asopids,
it is not possible strictly to separate the legends of the house of
Atreus from the Trojan Cycle, but the Tantalus, Oenomaus

Euripides yields percentages of 23 and 21 respectively. These

<p>§ 3. The tradition of the text.</p>
<note type="marginal">Tradition of the extant plays.</note> <p>The seven plays which still survive have been handed down
to us in a number of MSS ranging from the eleventh to the
sixteenth century, of which the oldest and best is the well-known
Laurentian, written in the first half of the eleventh century.
But, whereas twelve MSS contain all the seven plays, either
complete or with lacunae, and fifteen others four or more but
less than seven, no less than seventy are restricted to the Ajax,
Electra, and Oedipus Tyrannus alone, or to one or two of them 1
The preponderance of the three plays is readily explained by
their exclusive use for educational purposes during the Byzantine
period. The existence of this selection may perhaps be traced
as far back as to 500 A.D., if we may judge from the title of a
treatise written by Eugenius, head of the imperial school at
Constantinople under Anastasius I (491—518) and
of Stephen of Byzantium in the tenure of that office 2. The work
was entitled κωλομετρία τῶν μελικῶν Αἰσχύλου Σοφοκλέους καὶ
Εὐριπίδου ἀπὸ δραμάτων ιε΄3. That is to say, Eugenius, no
doubt following earlier scholars, published analyses of the lyrical
parts of the three tragedians similar to those which Heliodorus
constructed for Aristophanes, but limited his activity to fifteen
plays, three of Aeschylus, three of Sophocles, and nine of
Euripides 4. The number chosen corresponds to that of the
plays selected from Aeschylus (Prometheus, Seven, and Persae), as
well as of those taken later from Euripides (Hecuba, Orestes, and
Phoenissae); and each of these groups consists of the first three
plays, according to the order of an earlier and larger collection.
The history of the Euripidean tradition is more complicated, and
does not concern us here, but the earlier collections made from

the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles undoubtedly comprised
the fourteen plays which still exist. It must be recognized
therefore that the survival of particular plays is due not to the
accidental preservation of this or that MS from which all other
copies were derived, but rather to the educational needs which
prompted scholars to prepare annotated editions of select plays
for the use of schools. Of the circumstances attending the
publication of the earlier collection hardly a trace remains.
An Argument is attached to each of the two plays Oedipus
md Antigone bearing the name of a certain Sallustius,
and in the former he is described as Sallustius Pyhagoras. In
all probability therefore there was a tradition identifying him
with Sallustius the Pythagorean 1, the follower of Iamblichus
and author of the treatise περὶ θεῶν καὶ κόσμου 2, who belonged
to the latter part of the fourth century. This writer is probably
the same man as the friend of the emperor Julian, and has also
been identified with the sophist Sallustius to whom Suidas
ascribes commentaries on Demosthenes and Herodotus 3. Now,
if Sallustius, the editor of the select plays, lived at so late a date
as the second half of the fourth century, it is unlikely that he
was the first compiler of the selection 4. It will be shown later
that the direct quotation of tragedies other than those contained
in the select edition died out at the end of the second century.
Farther, it may be inferred, from the precise correspondence in
subject between the plays chosen from each of three great
tragedians which contain the stories of Oedipus and Orestes,
that the whole selection was made by a single person. person. B
this it is impossible to determine either author or date. Wilamoe

arrived at the conclusion that the selection was first made in the

acceptance 1.</p>
<p>We shall now proceed to give some account of the Sophoclean
tradition in antiquity in order to prepare the way for an examination
of the sources from which our knowledge of the lost plays
<note type="marginal">Athens to Alexandria.</note> is derived. The existence of written copies of Attic tragedies
can be traced back to the period of their production, that is to
say, to a date not later than the close of the fifth century B. C.,
as is proved by the well-known passage in Ar. Ran. 52 where
Dionysus speaks of reading to himself the Andromeda of Euripides;
and the force of v. 11 14 of the same play is very much
impaired if we do not understand it as implying that the text
of the tragedians was studied in literary circles. The learning
by heart of tragic ῥήσεις is mentioned by Plato 2, and Alexis
includes tragedies in a list of books which are recommended
for the improvement of Heracles, who however chooses a cookerybook
in preference to all of them 3. The earliest recognition of;
the necessity for maintaining the integrity of the tragic texts is
to be found in the law of Lycurgus the orator, which required
that an official copy of the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides should be preserved in the archives, and that in future
performances the actors should adhere to the text of this copy 4.
It has been suggested that the official text only contained such
plays as still kept the stage in the fourth century, but, as the
plays of Aeschylus were seldom reproduced at that time 5, it
was probably more comprehensive. In fact, if such an official
copy was ever made, although its primary purpose was not so I
much directly critical as to check the licence of of actors, it
may be presumed that the net was cast as wide as possible, and
that the most authoritative sources were consulted 6. It is

generally supposed that this was the copy subsequently borrowed
y Ptolemy Euergetes, when he left a deposit of fifteen talents
s security for its return. His professed object was to make
transcript for his own use; but, when this had been done, he
ent back the transcript to Athens in place of the original, and
he Athenians were obliged to content themselves with a forfeit
f the deposit 1. It may be open to doubt whether the reference

146 — 117 B.C.) 2, although the former is generally preferred; but
he historical truth of the story is of less importance than
he inferences to which it leads. Thus the acquisition of the
official copy was certainly not regarded as having settled the
ext of the tragedians, for otherwise the conjectures of Aristophanes
would not have been recorded in our scholia. A still
nore important fact to which the story testifies is the migration
f tragedy in the third century from Athens to Alexandria 3

where the study of the old tragedians was pursued with the

Argument to the Agamemnon of Aeschylus had been recognized
as a fragment of Aristotle's treatise 1, and a remarkable confirmation
of the accuracy of our tradition came to light in 1886, when
an inscription was discovered on the Acropolis, recording the
production of the Orestea, and agreeing exactly in the facts which
it mentions with the text of the Medicean MS 2. But the stoneinscription
was not the original record; for, so far as the contests
listed were earlier than Aristotle's time, the details to be inscribed
were taken from his book or were otherwise due to his researches 3.
Aristotle also wrote a treatise in one book entitled περὶ τραγῳδιῶν,
and another also in one book entitled νῖκαι Διονυσιακαί 4.
Of the former nothing whatever is known, and there is no probability
in Mueller's view 5 that it was related to the διδασκαλίαι
as a part to the whole or vice versa. We are equally in the
dark regarding the νῖκαι Διονυσιακαί, but it is a plausible conjecture
that it contained lists of winners in the various contests
at the Dionysia, the existence of which, beside the more elaborate
records relating to tragedy and comedy alone, is proved by inscriptions 6.
Dicaearchus of Messene (c. 310 B.C.) displayed no less
interest than his master in the province of dramatic criticism.
His work ὑποθέσεις τῶν Εὐριπίδου καὶ Σοφοκλέους μύθων 7 was
an investigation into the subject-matter of the plots of the
various plays of Euripides and Sophocles, and especially into
the sources from which they were derived, the extent of their
deviations from the traditional versions, and the reasons which
prompted such individual treatment 8. Traces of the handiwork
of Dicaearchus are to be seen in the first of the existing Arguments
to the Alcestis and the Rhesus. Another of his works,

Zenodotus, the first librarian, shared with Lycophron and Alex-

planation. There is no similar evidence to prove that he was
also responsible for editions of Aeschylus and Sophocles; but,
since no other assumption accounts equally well for the existence
of the ὑποθέσεις attributed to him which are attached to plays
of all three tragedians 1, recent scholars have been unanimous in
so concluding 2. It may be added that the discovery of the
Ichneutae papyrus, with marginal variants attributed to Aristophanes 3
makes strongly in the same direction. Wilamowitz
argued that the ὑποθέσεις were not accompanied by a commentary
on the text, and that the edition of Aristophanes was
intended rather for the general reader than for scholars4. However
this may be, there is evidence that he wrote a ὑπόμνημα—
or what we should call ῾lecture-notes᾿ —on the Orestes, as well
as on other plays5; and much of the aesthetic criticism which is
found in the scholia to Sophocles and Euripides has been
attributed to him. We must not forget his lexicographical
studies, plentiful remains of which are to be found in Eustathius,
and less patently in Hesychius, Pollux, and Athenaeus, not to
mention the excerpts still existing in medieval MSS which have
been published by Boissonade and E. Miller6. These studies
were entitled λέξεις7 or γλῶσσαι, and were divided into two main
classes: (i) collections of dialectical variants, (2) varieties of
subject-matter πεῖ ὀνομασίας ἡλικιῶν, περὶ συγγενικῶν

be taken to indicate that he published a ὑπόμνημα on the
Electra1. Callistratus, a pupil of Aristophanes, followed up
his master’s researches in the dramatic sphere, and, although
his name is better known from its frequent occurrence in the
scholia to Aristophanes and Euripides, there is evidence that he
also wrote commentaries on Sophocles2. Aristarchus (216—
144 B.C.), the most renowned of all the Alexandrian critics, was
a fellow-pupil and rival of Callistratus. The fame of his labours
on Homer has thrown into the shade his work on other poets;
but Dionysius Thrax* testifies that his familiarity with the tragic
texts was so great that he wa able freely to recite them from
memory. We meet with his name here and there as a witness
for a particular fragment4, and fr. 449 and schol. El. 6 (Hesych.
s.v. λυκοκτόνου θεοῦ) are sufficient to prove his interest in the
interpretation of the text. Nevertheless, as compared with that
of Aristophanes, his influence upon the course of subsequent
research was slight. With Aristarchus should be named his
chief opoponent Crates of Mallus, the most distinguished representative 
of the Pergamene school, who wrote upon Aristophanes
and Euripide, but is not proved by extant quotations to have
given special attention to Sophocles5.</p>

intellectual activities of the Hellenistic world. At the time when
Aristarchus was acknowledged to have reached the fullness of 
his critical powers the glories οf the kingdoms of Ptolemy,
Attalus, and Seleucus had passed Hitherto in Italy, although 
there was a considerable amount of colloquial familiarity with 
the Greek speech, the cultivation of Greek letters had been
confined to a limited circle. Ennius (239—169 B.C.), who was
half a Greek by birth, and earned his living by his skill as a 
teacher and writer, came forward as a propagandist of Hellenism.

His tragedies were for the most part adaptations of Euripides,
and he was followed by Pacuvius (219 — 129) and Accius (170 —
105), who constructed their plays with greater skill and included
Sophocles among their models. Unfortunately the fragments
of these writers are so scanty that they are very seldom of
service in the reconstruction of the Greek originals1. The
Romans were thus familiarized through the stage with the form
and contents of Greek tragedy before they were trained to study
them as literature. But after 146 B.C. the assimilation of Greek
culture spread rapidly. That which was at first the exclusive
possession of the ’c circle became in the next generation
the common heritage of every educated Roman. The everincreasing
demand for instruction brought the learning of
Pergamum and Alexandria into contact with the ruling class of
the imperial city. Educational requirements not only gavae an
enormous stimulus to the multiplication of copies of the most
famous Greek authors, but grammar and criticism themselves
were internationalized. Alexandria ceased to be the home of
the most learned professors, and gradually lost its supremacy in
the world of letters, although, as the birth-place of Didymus,
Herodian, Harpocration, and many others, it continued for three
centuries to preserve its reputation as the ultimate source of
philological erudition. It is not surprising, in view of these
circumstances, that the name of Didymus, who, after the lapse
of more than a century, comes next on the list of Sophoclean
editors, should be associated with a change in method calculated
to adapt his lucubrations to. the requirements of the Roman
world.</p>
<note type="marginal">Didymus.</note> <p>Didymus. Didymus is the most important name in our survey, not so
much in consequence of his individual merit, although this has
perhaps been undeservedly belittled, as because we owe to him
more than to any other single person the preservation of such
fragmentary knowledge as we possess respecting the lost plays of
the Greek tragedians. The extraordinary industry of Didymus,
which earned for him the epithet χαλκέντερος, may be estimated
by his performance in the field of literary criticism alone, in
<note type="footnote">1 The leading authority on the plots of the Roman tragedians is O. Ribbeck, die

<pb n="xli"/>
which he undertook the interpretation of Homer, Hesiod, Pindar
and Bacchylides, the tragedians, Aristophanes and other comic
poets, and the Attic orators. The importance of his collections
to modern research becomes apparent when we learn that large
portions of the existing scholia to Pindar, Euripides, and Aristophanes
are drawn from the commentaries of Didymus, and that
his writings are the ultimate source of the scholia to Sophocles.
It is significant that in these, while the names of the older
Alexandrian grammarians are scarcely mentioned or else are
replaced by such general descriptions as ’the commentators1,'
that of Didymus occurs at least nine times 2. These commentaries
were not simply ὑπομνήματα in the sense previously
indicated, but were accompanied by a text 3. The older gramns
had lectured to their pupils from a plain text, but
conditions were now very different, and the wider public for
whom the editions of Didymus were intended could not dispense
with explanatory notes. The function of Didymus should not
be misconceived. He was neither an original thinker nor an
pendent investigator: his province was to collect the results
garnered by earlier scholars, and to make them serviceable to
the needs of his contemporaries and his successors. It has been
inferred that these books were the prototypes of the class afternted
by the medieval MSS, in which the ma
inding the text are occupied with exegetical comment and
critical variants 4. Recent discoveries of papyri, which have been
sufficiently numerous to familiarize us with the form and aspect
of the papyrus roll, have only partially confirmed this conclusion.
It ii true that critical and explanatory notes are found in them,
<note type="footnote">1 See Cohn in Pauly-Wi-sowa v 451. There b a good instance in tchol. Anl. 45

and particularly in the Paris fragments of the Partheneion of
Alcman, which are ascribed to the first century A. D., and the
Oxyrhynchus papyrus of the Paeans of Pindar, which belons
to the early part of the second. But they are very scantily
represented in the Hypsipyle and Ichneutae papyri, and there are
obvious reasons why a continuous commentary was less suitable
for inclusion in the papyrus roll than in the parchment book of
a later age. It follows that the existing scholia, although in
substance based upon the results of Alexandrian learning, are
not formally and directly the completion of an original Alexandrian
nucleus 1. The growth of the various collections cannot
be traced in detail, since for the most part the secure support
of names and dates is wanting 2. A glance at ’s Index
of Sources will show that many of the fragments are quoted in
the scholia to the writers enumerated above, but a still greater
number is derived from the lexicographical labours of Didymus.
The prefatory letter to Eulogius, which Hesychius placed in the
forefront of his lexicon, refers to the separate vocabularies of
comic and tragic diction λέξεις) which Theon and Didymus
had composed. According to recent critics 3, the meaning is not
that Theon was the author responsible for a ΚωμιΚὴ λέξις and
Didymus for a τραγικὴ λέξις, but that each of them made a
collection of the idioms and phraseology of both branches. The
scope of Theon's activity is obscure in the absence of further
information, but we shall presently return to him. So far as
Didymus is concerned, there is ample evidence elsewhere to
confirm the statement οἱ the letter that he published a κωμικὴ
λέξις as well as a τραγικὴ λέξις. The τραγικὴ λέξις was arranged
according to the alphabetical order of the words, and divided
into books, of which Harpocration quotes the twenty-eighth 4.
Further, it should be noted that the lexicon was closely connected
with the separately published commentaries to the tragic
poets. It is a natural assumption that it contained a series

of lexicographical excerpts from the commentaries, and the
identity of treatment is proved by examples of the same matter
expressed in the same words by the lexicographers, who used
only the λέξεις, and the scholia, which derive from the commentaries
of Didymus 1. Of course the lexicographical notes
of Didymus were largely a compilation from the λέξεις of
Aristophanes, from the Ἀττικαὶ λέξεις of Crates of Mallus, and
other authorities too numerous to mention. Hut the τραγικὴ
λέξις, in its turn, became a treasure-house for successive
plunderers to rifle. A lexicon, as Wilamowitz remarks 2, soon
ceases to be left intact, as befits a private possession: each
succeeding generation reconstructs, abbreviates, or enlarges,
according to its needs. Pamphilus of Alexandria, who belonged <note type="marginal">Pamphilus.</note>
to the middle of the first century A.D., and was the last of the
starcheans, incorporated the τραγικὴ λέξις in his encyclolic
treatise entitled λειμών or περὶ γλωσσῶν καὶ ὀνομάτων
in ninety-five books. His object was to collect and enlarge
departmental labours of his predecessors in their vmriow
vinces. The first part of the work περὶ γλωσσῶν) contained
the lexicons devoted to particular authors, branches of literature,
and dialects 3; and the second περὶ ὀνομάτων) was divided
according to varieties of subject-matter (cookery, shipbuilding,
and so forth). In the reign of Hadrian appeared an epitome

books 4. But for practical purposes even this reduction in bulk

and by a severe restriction of the explanatory material. The
work of Diogenian, notwithstanding these deficiences, proved
adequate for its purpose. It was widely used as a handbook of
reference so long as the classical authors continued to be read,
and its existence can be traced in the Byzantine period down to
the twelfth century 1. So completely was Pamphilus superseded
by the epitomator that Athenaeus and Herodian are almost the
only writers who made use of the fuller collection. For us
the παντοδαπὴ λέξις of Diogenian is especially of interest as the
<note type="marginal">Hesychius.</note> source from which Hesychius drew most of his material; for
the weight of authority inclines strongly in favour of the identification
with it of the περιεργοπένητες which Hesychius ascribes
to Diogenian in the prefatory letter 2. Thus Hesychius is the
chief extant authority through which we can pass back to the
τραγικὴ λέξις of Didymus, but the extent of the loss incurred
in the epitomizing process can only be judged by the rare
instances where a complete fragment of Didymus has been
preserved 3. Reference has already been made to the statement
<note type="marginal">Theon.</note> of Hesychius that Theon as well as Didymus was the author of
lexicons to the tragic and comic poets. The conjecture of Naber
that Theon was the compiler, and that he put them together
from the material scattered throughout the commentaries of
Didymus, fails to account for the explicit references to the
lexicons of Didymus. But Theon is of importance for other
reasons. His services to Alexandrian literature were similar to
those rendered by Didymus to the earlier poets: he is mentioned
in the subscriptio as one of the sources for the exsting scholia to
Apollonius; and it is sufficiently established that he devoted
considerable attention to the elucidation of Theocritus, Callimachus,
and Lycophron, and published annotated editions of
their poems 5. Nevertheless, it has come as a surprise to find
his name several times mentioned in the margin of the Ichneutae

there is no other evidence except the statement already quoted
from Hesychius to connect Theon with the tragic poets2, and
the character of his edition and its relation to Didymus are
equally obscure. It should be addded that another grammarian,
whose name may have been Nicanor, is quoted in the same
papyrus but cannot be identified3.</p>
<p>After the time of Didymus and Theon there is no further <note type="marginal">The second century A. D.</note>
1 of editions of the tragedians. In fact, after the lapse of second centu
a century, the need for such comprehensive studies in this branch A.D.
of literature was rapidly disappearing. The age of Hadrian, so
often celebrated as an era of renaissance in literary taste, was
actually that in which the causes of ultimate decay begin to be
visible. The days of creative genius were past. Literature had
me self-conscious, and every literary aspirant, instead of
king to express his own thoughts in his own way. made it
prime object to fashion his style according to the recognized
al models. Rhetorical sophistic, of which Aelius Aristides
and the Philostrati are the most characteristic representative.
flourished exceedingly throughout the reigns of the Antonines.
The vices of this literature were its artificiality, affectation, and
excessive elaboration; its indifference to reality, and its hollowness;
and its entire sacrifice of matter to form. Quintilian's
maxim pectus est quod disertos facit was forgotten; and the
researches of the Atticists from Aelius Dionysius to Phrynichus
Were directed primarily to the practical end of assisting the art
of public speaking4. The last thing they had in view was a
scientific study of the Attic dialect; and, besides
rs, only those authors were cultivated whose vocabulary
adapted to rhetorical requirements. In these conditions,
tragedy and lyric poetry were the first to suffer,—not
cles and Pindar were dethroned from their high place, but

in a busy world they must submit to exercise their sway chiefly
within the walls of the school-room. Hence arose the need
for a selection, since the schoolmaster does not claim to be a
scientific investigator who requires constant access to the whole
of his material. There is thus good reason for the conclusior
adopted by Wilamowitz that the selection of seven plays came
into being during the course of the second century, althoug
the name of the selector has not been recorded. It does not
course follow that the appearance of the selection led at once t
the loss of the remaining plays. Copies of them were preserve
in the public libraries, which might still have been consulted b
professional students. We know also that the multiplication
transcripts on papyrus rolls still continued in Egypt1, and no doub
elsewhere, so that readers must still have been forthcoming in
certain circles. But, as demonstrating the loss of their influenc
on general culture, the subsequent absence of direct quotation
decisive.</p>
<p>§ 4. The Sources of the Fragments.</p>
<p>Now that we have followed the course of the tradition b
which the plays of Sophocles were transmitted through Alexandria
to the Roman and Byzantine eras, we are in a better
position to examine the character of the documents in which
the surviving fragments are preserved. These may be classified
according to their origin as follows: (1) fragments of Sophoclean
papyri; (2) direct quotations; and (3) indirect quotations. The
third class, which is by far the most numerous, includes every
case in which the author of the extant source owes his information
not directly to Sophocles, but to some intermediate writer.</p>
<note type="marginal">Papyrus fragments.</note> <p>Papyrus The papyrus fragments are very few in number, and, except
those belonging to the Eurypylus and Ichneutae, not of much

that play1; the scanty relics of the Niobe have some bearing
Sophocles’ handling of the story2; and the fragments provisionally
assigned to the Tantalus in this edition, if they are the work
Sophocles at all, raise a question of considerable inerest3.
All these, except the Niobe fragments, which are attributed to
the third century B.C., are believed to have been written in the
second century A.D., so that their date is entirely consistent with
the conclusion reached in the last section4.</p>
<p>It is a more difficult matter to decide which are the latest
direct quotations from the lost plays, because we cannot always
be certain whether a reference which purports to come direct
from Sophocles has not in fact been borrowed from an earlier
authority whose existence is not acknowledged in the source.
To take a capital instance, no one now believes that the swarms
tions with which Clement of Alexandria fills certain
tions of his writings were due to his immediate acquaintance
with the text the authors cited. We shall subsequently
explain how he came by them.</p>

of the total. of those which arc altogether or almost contemporary
the most numerous and important are the plays of the
comic poets. Aristophanes refers to the Niobe by name and to
the Tereus and Tyro in unmistakable terms5; and at least sixteen
ns to or parodies of the Sophoclean text are wared
by the evidence of the scholia6. It is curious that five
belong to the Peleus, a play not otherwise much quoted;
of the same group is further echoed by a comic writer,
who may have been Aristophanes himself, and was at any rate
rary7. The Old Comedy is also represented by

the Middle by an interesting parody of Antiphanes1. At
later date Menander copied a famous trimeter which was in
everyone's mouth2; and another imitation of the same line
appears in the collection of monosticha which passes by the same
writer's name. This miscellany, which was not put together
until Roman times, while containing much that Menander certainly
did not write, includes a number of lines which appear
to follow the tracks of Sophocles. Here or there may be an
instance where Menander deliberately repeated a tragic verse;
but most of them, whether transmitted through his agency or
that of others, had become current as publica materies, having
long ceased to be recognized as subject to the private dominion
of Sophocles3.</p>
<p>We pass to the prose-writers of the fourth century. Two
allusions to Sophoclean fragments have been traced in the
dialogues of Plato, but neither is free from doubt4. On the
other hand, by a curious error, which he shared with Aristophanes
and Antisthenes, he attributed to Euripides a line which
certainly belonged to the Locrian Ajax5. Demosthenes in a
well-known passage mentions the appearance of Aeschines in
the title-role of the Oenomaus. Aristotle in the poetics refers to
the Euryphlus, Lacaenae, Niptra, Peleus, Phthiotides, Tereus, and
Tyro, and perhaps to the Polyxena; while in the rhetoric he cites
the σύνδειπνοι, Teucer, and Tyro6. Reasons have also been
given for supposing that he has wrongly ascribed to Aeschylus
a fragment of considerable length which actually came from the
Tereus7. The plot of the Aleadae was detected by means of

art of rhetoric must be distilled to serve the needs of the less 
robust intelligences. In addition to the stimulus imparted by 
the requirements of the higher education, there arose a spirit 
of general curiosity in polite circles, which contributed towards 
the literary splendours of the Augustan age. Such considerations 
will explain that, where dependence upon authority was 
universal, its frequent acknowledgement became tedious and 
unnecessary: a reference or allusion might be borrowed without 
any sacrifice of literary candour. But the character of the 
witness is a most material factor in the valuation of the record, 
and it is also essential to remember the particular object which 
he had in view. At first sight there is no reason to suspect that 
Ovid's reference to the Ἀχιλλέως ἐρασταί1, and Horace's to the 
Peleus2, were not inspired by their familiarity with the texts of 
the Greek tragedians. But we cannot so conclude with any 
certainty: there is abundant evidence of Ovid's dependence on 
the mythographical tradition, and the Ars Poetica is known to 
have been based upon the treatis of Neoptolemus of Perium3.
A specimen of the manuals available for the use of the Augustan 
poets is preserved in the booklet of Parthenius of Nicaea περὶ 
ἐρωτικῶν παθημάτων. As its title indicates, this was a collection 
of love-stories with unhappy endings, each of which is prefaced 
with a statement of the literary authority or authorities responsible 
for the form of the narrative adopted4. The work
was dedicated to Cornelius Gallus, the elegiac poet, and was 
written expressly for the purpose of assisting his memory, if 
he chose to empoly the material in future poems. The Euryalus 
of Sophocles5 is quoted as sole authority for the tale of Odysseus'
love for Euippe and its fatal issue, and to Parthenius, if not to

curious information relating to the Idaean Dactyls1. <note type="marginal">The elder Pliny.</note>
naturalis historia of the elder Pliny (23—69 A.D) is a work
which to an even greater extent was made up of excerpts taken
from previous authors. No fewer than 146 Roman and 327
foreign writers were utilized for the purpose; and so little was
Pliny disposed to conceal his obligations that he prefixed to
each book a list of the chief authorities upon which it depended.
Of the fragments which he cites from Sophocles2 the first is
inserted in the course of a passage borrowed from Theophrastus,
and the manner of its introduction shows that Pliny had ac
to the tradition of the didascaliae; the second is a botanical
memorandum, which came immediately from Sextius Niger,

the repetition of Dio Cassius and Appian; and one may suspect
that in some οf the ethical treatises, such as the περὶ τύχης and
the περὶἀρετῆς καὶ κακίας, which by their style betray the 
influence of the philosophical schools, the quotations were taken
over together with the text which they served to illustrate1.

<note type="marginal">Atticism.</note> <p>The second century A.D. owes such importance as it possesses
in the history of Greek literature in large measure to the classical
revival known as Atticism. It was, as has been already pointed
out, the product of an age to which substance had become less
essential than style, and whose study of the ancient classics was
limited by the practical object of fostering rhetorical ability.
We shall presently describe the efforts of the lexicographers
to provide the studious with the necessary material for the
cultivation of purity of diction; the general literature, if we
include under this term the representative sophists, is of minor
importance for the present purpose, and will not detain us long.
The most famous names of the Hellenic renaissance which
started in the reign of Hadrian, and lasted for more than a
century, are Lucian, Aristides, and the Philostrati. Lucian refers
to the Locrian Αjax3, perhaps also to the Cedalion4, and quotes
a fragment from the Meleager without naming the play5. Aelius
Aristides shows his acquaintance with the text of the Ἑλένης

the work of incendiaries at Eleusis7. The Philostrati scarcely

from the Oedipus Tyranuus, Oedipus Coloneus, and Antigone.
in the Life of Apollonius, and from the Electra in the Lives of
the sophists,—sufficient evidence surely that in his day
plays had a certain degree of celebrity above their fellows. In
the heroieus and imagines, which are ascribed to his kinsman
and contemporary known as Philostratus the Lemnian1, there
may be many reminiscences of tragedy, such as the passage
quoted by Nauck in illustration of the discoveries of Palamedes2;
but they are seldom acknowledged, and have in consequence
generally ceased to be traceable. The imagines of the younger
Philostratus, who describes himself as grandson of the Lemnian
the mother's side, are separated by an interval of seventy or
ars from the publication of the earlier series. He quote
the Oedipus Coloneus and the Philoctetes, and his allusion to
Sophocles’ description of Scyros as wind-swept3, and his
of the meeting of Phoenix with Neoptolemus, suggest that
he was acquainted with the Scyrians. Hut the general character

abundant supply of quotations is rendered unusually difficult
by the fact that the Deipnosophists has come down to us in an
abbreviated form, and by the tendency of its author to interrupt
the course of a borrowed extract with material which he had
gathered elsewhere1. It is admitted that he was not merely
a compiler. He had studied widely in the ancient texts for the
purpose of illustrating his various topics, and a considerable
proportion of the numerous passages taken from the plays of
the comic poets was undoubtedly due to his own researches.
Tragedy was less likely to provide him with material; and he
was content to accept its evidence at second hand. At any
rate, a careful scrutiny into the character of his quotations from
Sophocles will confirm the judgement pronounced by Wilamowitz2
that not a single tragedy was quoted directly. Although
the nature of Athenaeus’ book, even apart from its tradition,
such as unduly to favour the impression that it largely consists
of glosses unskilfully strung together, we shall hardly err in
concluding that many of the Sophoclean fragments were derived
from the lexicographers. That the glosses were taken from a
lexicon is sometimes betrayed by their alphabetical order, as
may be seen from the list of cups given in the eleventh book,
where the name of Pamphilus occurs several times. It has
already been mentioned that Pamphilus, who was perhaps the
chief lexicographical authority of Athenaeus, had incorporated
the results of Didymus’ τραγικαὶ λέξεις Athenaeus often
the name of his authority,—the ultimate, it may be, rather
than the immediate source. Thus, fr. 718 was derived from the the
commentary of Didymus, fr. 324 from Speusippus περὶ 3
fr. 28 from Cephisodorus the pupil of Isocrates, fr. 111 from
Tryphon4, and fr. 12 from Life Life of Archytas. In

regard to fr. 606 a neat point arises which is not without a bearing on the criticism

quently that this conclusion may be recommended on other grounds.</note>

other cases the source may be identified by inference or probable
conjecture. Thus fr. 502 is shown to have been derived from
Apollodorus Trepi haiptov by its recurrence in Harpocration,
fr. 448 may be referred to Chamaeleon1, fr. 765 to Satyrus or
Hermippus, fr. 121 to Clearchus περὶ γρίφων, fr. 474 to the same
writer's έρωτικά, fr. 307 to his περὶ παροιμιῶν2, and fr. 735 to
Theophrastus περὶ μέθης. Sometimes the ownership of the
borrowed material is no longer traceable3, or the quotation
the appearance of having been made independently for
the position which it occupies4. But an example will show that
appearances are not always to be trusted. In the course of a
-ion on the use of μύρον and its effect upon the senses,
Athenaeus interpolates as a reason for anointing the breast the
ient that the vital principle (ψυχή) is situated in the
and appeals to the testimony of Soph. fr. 766 amongst other
poetical authorities. The names of two physicians Praxagoras
and Phylotimus are mentioned as holding the same opinion,
and at first sight it might be inferred that Athenaeus either
took his quotations from one or the other of them, or collected
them himself in corroboration of their view. But the dogma
that the principate (ἡγεμονικόν) of the soul, that is to say,
mind, resides in the heart was strenuously maintained by the

we find that the two separate lines which Athenaeus quotes
from the Οdyssey appear at the head of the list of Homeric
quotations which Galen repeats after Chrysippus2. If any

by the further discovery that Chrysippus appealed to
the authority of Praxagoras in opposition to those medical
writers who made the head the centre of the nervous system3.</p>
<note type="marginal">Scientific and technical wrters.</note> <p>The scientific and departmental writers who flourished in

70 B.C.). Artemidorus, who wrote on the interpretation of
dreams, cites fr. 860 without the author's name and obviously at

Bernays showed that the de abstinentia was largely composed
tracts from Theophrastus trepl εὐσεβείας2. Hyginus the
mythographer is of importance rather in relation to the plots of
the lost plays than as a witness to the fragments. The date
of the handbook can only be determined in so far as it was
certainly written before 207 A..D., when it was translated into
Greek3; but the scholarship of its author may be gauged by his
iption of Melanippe as daughter of Desmon, no doubt after

study of whose writings was kept alive by the lectures of the
Peoplatonists, are the only ancient authors to whom he freely
refers1. Libanius (314—393 A.D.), the foremost man of
of age, is hardly in a better case than his imperial patron,
although his reading was naturally wider2. It is true that his
acquaintance with Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides is
vouched on the authority of his latest editor3; but it is not
evident that this implies a wider knowledge of their text than
is open to a scholar of the present day. His reference to the
II p. 224) does not prove that he knew the play, and
allusion to the ill treatment of Minos on the stage was derived
Plutarch or the pseudo- Platonic Minos4. Though Libanius
1 sole authority for fr. 808, the sentiment there expressed
is of a familiar currency; and the appearance of two parallel
ges from Euripides5 in the immediate context sug
that all three were borrowed from an anthology. Nor is the
character of his other references to tragic fragments such as to
inspire confidence in the extent of his knowledge6. Synesius,
raa born a feu years after the death of Julian and survived
Libanius by some twenty years, is one of the most attractive
figures of his age. He is the last representative of the genuine
Hellenic spirit, never ceasing to urge upon his hearers the
importance of literary and philosophical studies7. But his own
ledge was neither deep nor wide, and the preponderating

a vague reference to Ai. 1146 2 is almost the only indication of
an acquaintance with Sophocles.</p>
<note type="marginal">Scholia.</note> <p>The immediate sources of the greater number of the frag
ments are the collections of scholia, the Byzantine lexicons, and
the anthology of Stobaeus. The most important of the scholia
are found in the MSS of the three tragedians, Aristophanes,
Homer, Pindar, Plato, and the Alexandrian poets. The labours
of Didymus in relation to Sophocles and Euripides have already
been mentioned, and his services to Aeschylus, although less
clearly attested, are believed to have been of a similar character3.
The remaining scholia, so far as they concern us here, will next
be briefly described.</p>
<note type="marginal">Aristophanic scholia.</note> <p>The scholia of Aristophanes, although for obvious reasons
their evidence more often touches Euripides, are nevertheless,
as we have seen4, considerable considerable importance for Sophocles.
The citations from ancient poets were due almost entirely to
Didymus5, who here as elsewhere drew upon the learning of his
predecessors. The extent of his influence is not to be measured,
except in comparison with others, by the sixty-four explicit
references to his name6. Phaeinus and Symmachus, who are
mentioned in the subscriptio of the Venetus to the Nubes and to
the Pax, have been identified as the immediate sources of the
extant collection. Symmachus, whose name occurs some forty
times in the scholia, was an Alexandrian who lived about a
century after Didymus, and shows himself to be capable of
exercising an independent judgement7. Phaeinus, by some
regarded as an early Byzantine, is of no importance except as

<p>We owe twenty-two valuable quotations to the scholia on <note type="marginal">Pindaric scholia.</note>
Pindar. These may be assigned without hesitation to Didymus,
who was responsible for practically the whole of the learned
material preserved in these commentaries1. Our collection goes
back to an edition of the Epinicia in the second century A.D.,
which repeated the substance of Didymus’ work without
much of importance. The date is approximately fixed by a
quotation from Amyntianus2, a writer who dedicated his history
lexander lexander the Great to the emperor Marcus. In two instances
at least we are able to go beyond Didymus: the illustration of
τριῶν ἕν3 was taken from the περὶ παροιμιῶν of Aristides
Miletus, which is dated in the second half of the second
century Β.C.4, and the proverb ἀφ᾿ ἑστίας ἄρχεσθαι was discussed
by Aristocritus, who belonged to the same period5.</p>
<p>The minute study of the Platonic dialogues was not seriously <note type="marginal">Platonic scholia.</note>
undertaken before the age of the Roman empire, and received
hief impulse from the Neoplatonic movement. Our scholia,
however, deal with the explanation of rare words (γλῶσσα

which contain quotations from Sophocles are repretive
of the general character of the collection. It is not

Thus Didymus is referred to on Cratyl. 384 A in connexion
with the proverb yahzira ra icaXd, and to him rather than to
Tarrhaeus1 were due most of the quotations in schol. rep. 337 A.
It should be noticed that the explanations of the Platonic scholia
are generally fuller and richer than the text text the corpus.</p>
<note type="marginal">Scholia on Alexandrians.</note> <p>The scholia to the Alexandrians, of whom Apollonius Rhodius
is for the present purpose the most important, may be taken
together. In all of them Theon2 occupies a position analogous
to that of Didymus in the criticism of the tragedians and Pindar.
The subscriptio to the Laurentian MS of Apollonius states that
the scholia are taken from Lucillus Tarrhaeus, Sophocles, and
Theon. This is interpreted to mean that Sophocles put together
the collection in the fourth century from the earlier commentaries
of Lucillus and Theon3. Irenaeus (also known by the Latinized
name of Minucius Pacatus), who is mentioned four times in the
scholia as the author of a commentary (ὑπόμνημα), seems
have belonged to the latter part of the first century A.D. Theon
was the sole source of all that is valuable in the scholia to
Theocritus, but our collection belongs to a later date. Wilamowitz
conjectured that they were edited by Amarantus, an elder
contemporary of Galen, whose name is attached in the Etymologicum
Magnum to the views expressed in the scholia4. This
assumption agrees with the fact that the scholia often controvert
the opinions of a certain Munatius, who is identified with
Munatius ὁ κριτικός, a native of Tralles and a member of the
circle of Herodes Atticus5. In Steph. Byz. Byz. p. 10 we
that Theon, Plutarch, and Demetrius Phalereus were the names
of the commentators on Nicander. The last-mentioned is unquestionably
an error for Demetrius Chlorus who is referred to
in several notes6 as supporting views subsequently rejected by
Antigonus. Antigonus lived in the early part of the first
century B.C., as is inferred from the position in which his name
<note type="footnote">1 Cf. fr. 160. According to Cohn, in Jahrb. f. cl. Phil. Suppl. xm at p. 84c
Tarrhaeus was the immediate source of these scholia. See however Crusius, And

occurs in the preface to Erotian1, so that in the case of Nicander
we are able to pass back to sources anterior to Theon. On the
other hand, with the exception of Theon, tradition is silent
respecting the names of those who worked on the text of
Lycophron until the time οf Nicetas, the bishop οΙ Serrha, who

<p>It is unnecessary for the present purpose to examine in <note type="marginal">Homeric scholia.</note>
detail the history of the Homeric scholia; for it is notorious that
they contain rich stores of Alexandrian learning. Even in the
limited field of Sophoclean quotations the value of Venetus A is
manifest. From the subscriptiones at the end of every book it
appears that the collection, which was perhaps made in the
second century A.D., was based upon an amalgamation of excerpts
from Didymus’ περὶ τῆς Ἀρισταρχείου διορθώσεως,
Aristonicus’ περὶ σημείων τῶν τῆς Ἰλιάδος καὶ τῆς Ὀδυσσείας2,
Herodian’s περὶ τῆς Ὁμηρικῆς προσῳδίας, and Nicanor's περὶ
Ὁμηρικῆς στιγμῆς. The works of Didymus, Aristonicus, and
Nicanor belonged to the department of textual criticism; and
of the ten quotations and allusions which rest upon the authority
of Ven. A five may be conjectured to owe their survival to
Herodian3. The explanation of γλῶσσαι and λέξεις4, where the
scholia are found to be in agreement with the extant lexicons,
was largely the work οf Aristarchus, whose name is mentioned
together with Apion and Heliodorus in Hesychius’ prefatory
letter to Eulogius. The lexicon of Apollonius, which depended
on the sources, survives only in an abridged form, so that
it is seldom of value where a fuller version elsewhere3.
In one case we are referred to the authority of Crates of Mallus6.
The elucidation of mythological details was the principal subject
of Didymus’ ὑπομνήματα7, and many notes of this complexion
in the scholia are attributed to him by name.</p>

(παρεκβολαὶ εἰς τὴν ‘Ομήρου ’Ιλιάδα [Ὀδύσσειαν])
must be mentioned. They were written at some time before
1175 A.D., in which year their author was appointed Archbishop
of Thessalonica by the emperor Manuel I. The value of the
books consists in their enormously rich store of extracts from
philological writings which have now been lost; for it is quite
certain that the quotations from the ancient classics were all at
second hand, and that the plays of Sophocles outside the selection
had perished long before the time of Eustathius1. Nor does
Eustathius seek to conceal his dependence upon earlier sources,
although he often succeeds in hiding their identity by the use of
such vague expressions as φασί, Kara τοὺς παλαιούς, λέγεται,
and the like2. But, although this lack of precision and still
more the tendency to garble his extracts by abbreviation are to
be regretted, the main channels of tradition which Eustathius
followed are either obvious or have been definitely ascertained2.
Thus, he borrowed large blocks of material from the Deipnosophists
of Athenaeus, and is in no sense an independent witness
for the quotations of the earlier writer4. It should also be
noticed that his text of Athenaeus was the epitomized version-
represented in the MSS known as C and E5. Strabo was copied
almost as freely as Athenaeus, but only twice where Sophocles
is concerned6 Next, it is certain that much of Eustathius is
nearly related to the tradition of the Homeric scholia. For the
Iliad he employed a MS containing a collection of scholia which
<note type="footnote">1 This fact was first clearly recognized by Valckenaer, Opusc. 1 337f. Jebb on
O. T. 1264 and on Ant. 292 (at p. 250) gives the impression that Eustathius’
tions were usually made at first hand. It is clear, also, from the remarks in his
Bacchylides (p. 76) that he took the same view of citations by such writers as Stobaeus
and Priscian. Rutherford in his New Phrynichus (p. 84) does not appear to have
observed that the evidence of the Etym. M. goes back to the older authorities from
which it is derived.</note>

bore the names of Apion and Herodorus1, and was derived from
the same sources as the scholia in the extant Mss. Thus, the
of Eustathius sometimes coincides with Ven. A2, sometimes
with Ven. B or Townl., and is sometimes supplementary to both.
As an instance of the last-named alternative we may quote
fr. 458, which is one of several examples of παραλειψις given
istathius as well as by the Paris MS 2766 of the thirteenth
century3 in addition to those appearing in schol. BT. In the
v Eustathius followed a similar course; but, since the
exiting scholia to the Odyssey are much less full and important
than those to the Iliad, the value of the tradition represented by
thius becomes comparatively greater. Fr. 108 was found
istathius in his MS, amongst other illustrations of the word
λος, as part of a note of Porphyrius which is also preserved
in the ῾Ομηρικὰ ξητήματα, whereas in our scholia4 the reference
to Archippus5 is the only one of the post-Homeric quotations
remaining6. To Porphyrius should probably be referred the
interesting fr. 790, since it comes from an allegorizing original
which explained Athena as φρόνησις and Poseidon as ὑγρότης
εὔψυχος7. The origin of the material in Eustathitll is sometimes
sred by the severe curtailment of the Odyssean scholia.
Thus, his allusion to the Euryalus of Sophocles8 is part of a
rich in genealogical details attested by references to Hesiod,
Helianicus, and the Cyclic epics. We might well
speculate how Eustathius became possessed of so much inform. informarawn
from ancient authorities, were it not that the bare
ton of the earlier part the the note is preserved by schol. Q5.

Eustathius seldom referred to the scholia on other authors, so
that it would be wrong to suppose that fr. 895 was borrowed by
<note type="marginal">Suctonius.</note> him from the scholia to Euripides. An examination of the
context in Eustathius reveals that he has introduced into his
commentary a long extract from the work of Suetonius irepi
τῶν παρ᾿ Ἕγγηι παιδιῶν. The same origin is to be attributed
to frs. 429 and 479. The name of the author is not given by
Eustathius, but is mentioned by Suidas1, who records the existence
of another work by him entitled περὶ συσφήμων λέξεων
ἤτοι βλασφημιῶν καὶ πόθεν ἑκάστη. To the περὶ βλασφημιῶν
Eustathius owed his acquaintance with frs. 720 and 885. It is
at first sight surprising that these little-known works, written in
Greek by a Roman historian of the age of Hadrian, should have
survived and continued in use until the late Byzantine era.
No less striking than the survival of Suetonius, who was, of
course, the depositary of earlier learning, is the appearance in
Eustathius of a number of quotations ascribed to Aristophanes of
Byzantium2. The latter were held by Nauck in his monograph
on Aristophanes to have been derived from the Homeric scholia;
but the publication by Emmanuel Miller in 1868 of the contents,
of a remarkable MS formerly at Mt Athos3 showed that these as
well as the extracts from Suetonius had a peculiar history. For
the MS comprises, besides the collection of proverbs attributec
to Zenobius, short excerpts from Zenodorus περὶ τῆς Ὁμήρου
συνηθείας, from the λέξεις (περὶ ὀνομασίας ἡλικιῶν and
of Aristophanes, and from the works of Suetonius already
quoted. Each of them contains passages closely parallel to the
text of Eustathius, although he names Aristophanes alone of

the three authors, and even in his case sometimes substitutes
φασί or κατὰ τοὺς παλαιούς. Thus the nature of the evidence

to his unfortunate methods of reference already described, it Pausanias.
has become a question of some difficulty and complexity to
determine the extent of territory to be assigned to one or both
of them, and in a less degree to distinguish the boundaries of
their respective provinces. So far as Sophocles is concerned,
me of Aelius Dionysius is not given as authority for any
of the fragments, whereas that of Pausanias occurs four times1.
But that is not all; for it is certain that many concealed refer-
to them are introduced by the formulas φασί, κατὰ τοὺς

late Byzantine age, was the source of various lexicons of
synonyms which were current under different names; and that
such was the history of the extant lexicon of Ammonius περὶ
ὁμοίων καὶ διαφόρων λέξεων is shown by its agreement with the
fragments of Herennius preserved by Eustathius. To Herennius,
therefore, belongs the distinction between ἐσχάρα and βωμός
which occasioned the quotation of fr. 7301, and the record of
ἐπίφατος in fr. 1048. We are not here concerned with
relation of Eustathius to any of the technical grammarians
except Herodian; and the coincidence of his text with the
ἐπιτομὴ τὠν ὀνοματικῶν κανόνων ἐΚ τῶν Ἡρωδιανοῦ, edited
Hilgard in a Heidelberg program of 1887, supports the view that
such excerpts rather than the complete treatises of Herodian
were alone accessible to him2.</p>

days of literary study3, but in Byzantine times, as the circle of
such studies continually narrowed, the professional teacher relied
more and more upon the practical manuals variously assigned
to the most eminent grammarians, and revised according to the
needs of the age by their successors. Examples of such books
have come down to us and some of them were published by
J. A. Cramer in his anecdota. The earlier type was so arranged
that the verbal explanations were made to follow the order of
the text4, but we are more immediately concerned with the cla

which quotes five Sophoclean fragments1 and is the

frequently named are Herodian and Aristonicus, and
amongst others we find mention of Apollonius, Alexion, Helio-
Seleucus, and Tryphon. The latest in time are Philoponus,
Orion, and Charax; and, since the name of Choeroboscus is
absent, the collection may be assigned to the early part of the
sixth century, between the dates of Charax and Choeroboscus2.

rodian, who was born at Alexandria, but lived subsequently at
Rome and enjoyed the favour of the emperor Marcus Aurelius,
made himself supreme in the domains of morphology and
accentuation. His reputation, continually enhanced by the
passage of his writings through the centuries, was earned by
the skilful reconstruction and careful elaboration of the results
which his predecessors had garnered, rather than by his success
in establishing new principles of general application1 Thus the
περὶ ὀρθογραφίας was derived from Tryphon2, and his
work, the καθολικὴ προσῳδία in twenty-one books, was founded
on the writings of Aristarchus, Tryphon, and Heracleides of
Miletus3. The book is known to us chiefly through excerpts,
appropriated by Theodosius and Arcadius, and we are similarly
placed in regard to all his other writings4, with the exception of
the small tract περὶ μονήρους λέξεως, which has survived intact
No fewer than fifteen valuable and independent quotations from
the lost plays of Sophocles are preserved in this little treatis5,
and it is a remarkable fact that it contains no others from any
tragic author, excepting two from Aeschylus and one from
Aristias of Phlius6. One might not unreasonably infer that
he either made for his own use a collection of these Sophoclean
instances or had access to a list compiled by some one else7.
The rhetorical treatise περὶ σχημάτων, from which is quoted
the exceptionally interesting fr. 799, has nothing to do with
Herodian the grammarian, although he is known to have made
use of the same title8. There has been some controversy as

the authenticity of the severely curtailed Φιλέταιρος, which is
printed at the end of Pierson's edition of Moeris (pp 431453
of the 1759 edition). The little book is undoubtedly of the
Atticist class, and has much in common with Phrynichus and
the lexicographical sources of Pollux and Athenaeus. It is
generally considered that Herodian had no affinity with the
Atticists1; and, although the possibility of its genuineness has
been advocated by Reitzenstein2, neither title nor contents
appear to support his view3.</p>
<p>The edifice constructed by the labours of Herodian and his
father was continually patched and repaired, enlarged or allowed
partly to fall into decay, by the various workers who succeeded
them; but the plan was never remodelled. It is needless to
a list of these worthies, but mention must be made of
who lived in the fifth century at Alexandria or Miletus
or at both4, since the lexicon Messanense edited by Rabe has
been identified as a fragment of his work πεπὶ 5.

quotes fr. 526, apparently from Orus. But he was himself a
representative of the grammatical tradition, and fr. 461 appears
in his extant work περὶ τῶν διαφόρως τονουμένων καὶ διάφορα
σημaινόντων. Five fragments are preserved by Priscian, who
was a contemporary of the emperor Anastasius (491—518).
Though a Latin grammarian, he depended largely upon Greek
authorities, and acknowledges in his dedication that it was his
intention to translate into Latin the rules of Apollonius Dyscolus
and Herodian. In fact, much of the Institutes proves to be a
reproduction of extant works of Apollonius and of the scholia
to Dionysius Thrax1. Fr. 880, which comes from the minor
work de Terentii metris, is of interest as belonging to another
branch of learning. Priscian's source was Heliodorus the
metrician, now securely dated in the middle of the first century
A.D., who quoted Sophocles’ line from the
of Seleucus, the Homeric scholar and contemporary of Tiberius2.
George Choeroboscus, perhaps the latest in date but by no means
the least, distinguished of the classical grammarians, occupied
a professional chair at Constantinople in the early part of the
sixth century. Several fragments of Sophocles are preserved
in his lectures on the εἰσαγωγικοὶ κανόνες περὶ κλίσεως ὀνομάτων
καὶ ῥημίτων of Theodosius of Alexandria, which were afterwards
published from the notes of his pupils. There is no doubt that
he depends upon lost works of Apollonius Dyscolus, Herodian,
and Orus, but he seems to have used them only in intermediate
sources, especially the writings of Philoponus and the grammarian
Zenobius3. Choeroboscus is also our chief authority for two
quotations drawn from his commentary on the Enchiridion
of Hephaestion4, in which he represents the tradition of the

sources employed by these writers will next be described. It is
unfortunate that the proverbial corpus is still accessible only
in the edition von von Leutsch and Schneidewin published at
Gottingen in 1839 1. For the publication by Emmanuel Miller
of the Athoan Ms mentioned above2 threw an entirely new light
on the history of these collections. It has been shown by Otto
Crusius3 that the vulgate MSS used by the editors of the corpus
represent later collections made in alphabetical order, and containing
either 552 proverbs attributed to Zenobius or about 1000
without an editor's name4. But, though these MSS still have
their value in supplying the gaps in our knowledge of the
earlier corpus, it is certain that the Athoan and other MS
which have since been found to belong to the same group
represent a more primitive attempt to form a corpus in which
the proverbs of Zenobius were retained in their original order.
In the archetype of these MSS the corpus was divided into five
which the first three contained the proverbs of Zenobin
fourth those passing by the name of Plutarch and entitled
Αλεξανδρεῦαι παροιμιῶν5, and the fifth a collection

made by an unknown sophist at a late date for use in the
rhetorical schools. A reference to Nauck's Index Pentium will
show that Zenobius—even within the limits of the Göttingen
corpus1—is by far the most important of the paroemiographers
as a source of quotations from tragedy; and although Macarius,
Gregory of Cyprus, and Apostolius are not entirely valueless as
witnesses to the tradition, they belong essentially to the same
group, and do not represent an early collection independent of;
Zenobius. The same remark applies to the collection of 776
Zenobian proverbs which passes by the name of Diogenian but
has nothing whatever to do with the lexicographer of that name2.
Zenobius, the author of the collection which lies at the base
of all extant records, was a sophist who lived in the reign of
Hadrian, and his work is described by Suidas as ἐπιτομὴ τῶν
παροιμιῶν Διδύμου καὶ Ταρραίου ἐν βιβλίοις γ΄.
Tarrhaeus we have already encountered as one of those responsible
for the scholia to Apollonius Rhodius; but, though
materials are lacking to determine the exact date of his literary
labours3, the character of the two passages where he is quoted
verbatim, apart from the fact that, while Didymus wrote in
thirteen books, Tarrhaeus as well as Zenobius wrote in three4,
shows that Tarrhaeus cannot have been the intermediate source
between Didymus and Zenobius5. We must rather regard
Didymus, with whose methods we are now familiar, as having
provided Zenobius with the bulk of his material and especially
with his quotations, while additions of moderate length were
made from the stories relating to various localities collected by
Tarrhaeus in the course of his travels. Thus we have seen that
Didymus rather than Tarrhaeus was the source of fr. 1606, and
the same is doubtless true of the remainder of our fragments,
<note type="footnote">1 It should be remembered that the Appendix proverbiorum is also Zenobian.</note>

although his authority cannot in every case be directly traced.
Didymus, of course, made his collection from the earlier writers
who had occupied themselves with the investigation of proverbs
either current in speech or recorded in literature. of these the
most important were Aristotle, Theophrastus, Clearchus, Demon,
Chrysippus, Aristophanes of Byzantium, Dionysodorus of Tro(??)
and Aristides. But Didymus was not merely a compiler:
while he brought together the explanations previously given, he
exercised his judgement freely in selecting from amongst them,
or in rejecting them all in favour of another suggested by his
own researches. Hence the fact that Zenobius often records
of explanatory glosses, although the names of their
advocates are seldom preserved1. Thus Aristophanes of Byzantium,
whose name is recorded in connexion with fr. 1044 2
and who, according to the reasonable inference of Crusius, w
the source of fr. 198 2, 3, was rebuked by Didymus for
the old poets with plagiarism4. Fr. 406 was one of the proverbs
explained by Chrysippus5; and Demon, who belonged to the
of the fourth or beginning of the third century, certainly
discussed the proverb Σαρδόνιος γέλως, although he is not the
source to which we owe the reference to the Daedalus6.</p>
<p>We pass to the lexicographers, the most copious, if not the <note type="marginal">Lexicogranhy.</note>
t fruitful source of our information. The supreme importance
of Hesychius in relation to the tragedians can easily be
isurcd by consulting the references to him in Nauck's Index;
but the history of the development which explains the comition
of his work has been treated in the preceding section,
and sundry explanations bearing on other lexicographers have
already been given and need not be repeated here. Aristophanes
intium was the founder of Greek lexicography; and his
immediate followers, adhering strictly to his example, confined
to the compilation of lists γλῶσσαι or λέξεις), not
necessarily alphabetical, of the words and phrases current in a
ticular branch of literature or appropriate to a particular art.

<pb n="lxxviii"/>
An early example was the γλῶσσαι of Nicander,
quoted by Athenaeus, which seems to have been intended to
explain obscure terms of local currency; another, also familiar
to readers of Athenaeus, was the ὀψαρτυτικαὶ λέξεις of Artemidorus;
and several collections of dialectical and literary words
were made by Tryphon. A favourite subject was, of course,
the explanation of Homeric γλῶσσαι, in which all
workers drew largely upon the labours of Aristarchus. The
extant lexicon of Apollonius has already been mentioned in
this connexion1. The συναγωγὴ τῶν παρ᾿ Ἱπποκράτει λέξεων
of Erotian is one of the most valuable remnants of Greek lexicography,
and alone preserves a number of tragic fragments, though
often, unfortunately, in a corrupt form. The author belonged
to the second half of the first century, and his book was dedicated
to Andromachus, the emperor ’s physician. His chief source
was the Hippocratean glossary of Baccheius of Tanagra (c. 200
B.C.), which is quoted 64 times, and through him he derived
much grammatical learning, including many quotations from
the poets2, from the λέξεις of Aristophanes of Byzantium3.
But Erotian also relied on other authorities, amongst whom
Heracleides of Tarentum (c. 75 B.C.), the author of a grammatical
treatise in three books πρὸς Βακχεῖον περὶ τῶν Ἱπποκράτους
λέξεων4, deserves special mention. The coincidence of Hesychius
and Erotian in fr. 550 is due to the fact that Erotian was amongst
the authorities consulted by Diogenian5. An explanation of the
greater fullness of Hesychius is to be found in the condition of our
<note type="footnote">1 See p. lxv. Although in frs. 729, 1092 Apollonius gives more than Hesychius, a

of extracts from Erotian among the Vatican scholia to

Aristophanes’ collection of Ἀττικαὶ λέξεις was put together
with the object of elucidating the sense in which they were
employed by classical authors; and we may account in the
same way for the similar titles found amongst the writings
attributed to Crates of Mallus, Demetrius Ixion, Philemon,
and others. But the Ἀττικαὶ λέξεις of Dorotheus, of which
Athenaeus quotes the 108th book2, belonged 1Ο the class οf
encyclopaedic compilations which were characteristic of the
first century A.D., and of which the ;joint work of Pamphilus
and Zopyrion was the most famous specimen. The <note type="marginal">Atticist lexicons.</note>
representative of Atticism in the narrower and stricter sense,
i.e. the school which aimed at the maintenance of a pure Attic
style in contemporary literature and conducted its researches
into classical usage with this express purpose in view, was
Irenaeus, the pupil of Heliodorus the metrician3, known also
by the Latinized name Minucius Pacatus. This tendency
appears clearly in a fragment οf Irenaeus quoted by Socrates,
the ecclesiastical historian of the fifth century, in which the
philosophical meaning of ὑπόστασις is condemned as βάρβαρον,
because the word was used by Sophocles as equivalent to
ἐνέδρα4. Aelius Dionysius, who lived in the age of Hadrian,
wrote Ἀττικὰ ὀνόματα in five books, and published two editions,
both of which were recognized by Eustathius5. The work was 
well known to Photius, who gives the above particulars in his
bibliotheca6, and its influence upon Byzantine lexicography was
very extensive. Pausanias, a Syrian and a contemporary of
Galen, wrote a similar work, work, which in the time of Photius was
regarded as a companion volume t the earlier lexicon, and was
bound up with it accordingly7. The difficulty of distinguishing

them has been increased, as we have seen, by the
of Eustathius; but in general it may be inferred that Aelius
Dionysius was more nearly concerned with questions of form
and expression, whereas Pausanias dealt with the technicalities
relating to public and private antiquities, and especially with
the explanation of proverbs1. Though the general line of their
tradition is free from doubt, the identity of the sources actually
followed is often obscure; for it is uncertain how much they
took direct from Aristophanes of Byzantium, or how much from
Didymus, Pamphilus, and Irenaeus. Their relation to Diogenian
has already been considered2. In spite of the difficulty involved
in tracing the influence of lost works, Eustathius has revealed
enough to enable us to identify them as one of the chief sources
followed by Photius in his lexicon, and to establish their claim
to the ownership of a number of glosses in the sixth lexicon
included in ’s anecdota3. Evidence bearing on both these
points will be found in the glosses which contain some of the
Sophoclean fragments4. The survival of part of his work has
made Phrynichus the best known of the Atticists to modern
scholars. He lived in the latter half of the second century, and
his great work the σοφιστικὴ προπαρασκευή was composed in
thirty-seven books. With the exception of the fragments which
can be recovered from other texts, the only part which has come
down to us is the extract ἐΚ τῶν ΦρυνίΧου τοῦ Ἀραβίου
σοφιστικῆς προπαρασκευῆς) preserved in the codex
345, and published as the first lexicon in Βekker's anecdota
(pp. 1—74). It has recently been re-edited by J. de

in accordance with the usage of Aristophanes, Thucydides, Plato,
and Demosthenes; so that his appeals to Sophocles were occasional
in character, when examples of the poetic style were
introduced by way of illustration1. The influence of Phrynichus
upon his successors is recognizable for us chiefly in Bekker's
sixth lexicon, where his name is quoted more frequently than
in any other ancient document2, and in Photius. This relationship
has been much more clearly established since the recovery
of the early part of Photius, to be mentioned later3. Phrynichus
by no means a mere copyist or epitomator; he was
in collecting material from the sources available to him. and he
exercised an independent judgement in the general inferences
which he drew from it. His eminence is shown by his rivalry
with Julius Pollux for the favour of the emperor Commodus4,
although he failed in his candidature for the professorial chair
at Athau which was given to Pollux. But it is altogether
ble to suppose that he went so far as to gather
of his illustrations directly from the pages of his Attic models5;
e cannot believe that he discarded the labours of his preany
more than a modern scholar would refuse to avail
himself of the help of indexes and lexicons. Thus, it is highly
probable that he profited by the work of Irenaens περὶ τῆς
Ἀλεξανδρέων διαλέκτου, in which an attempt was made to
that the Alexandrian usage was the direct descendant of the
Attic6. But we are not left to rely upon conjectm there

Aelius Dionysius1. Helladius, the author of a miscellany of
useful information composed in verse, who belongs to the early
part of the fourth century, survives in the prose version preserved
by Photius in his bibliotheca. He has so many points of contact
with Phrynichus that the σοφιστικὴ TrpoTrapaaicevr) has sometimes
been regarded as the sole source of his grammatical
information; but the conclusion is not generally accepted2
The Antiatticist, the second in order of Berkker's Lexicon3,
represents a reaction against the severest school of Atticism,
and was written with the object of showing that numerous
words and phrases which had passed under the ban, were in
fact employed by Attic writers of the best period. The authorship
is quite uncertain, but it was probably first put together
before the time of Orus, to whom Ritschl and others have
assigned it4. The ’s method was to take illustrations
from earlier grammarians of repute, and to quote the reference
to the ancient text. It has been argued that his chief source
was the Ἀττικαὶ λέξεις of Aristophanes of Byzantium5;
several of our glosses show points of contact with Diogentian6
and Herodian7. There are two cases in our collection8 showing
an unexpected agreement with Phrynichus, but these may be
due to the mutilation of our text. It should be observed that
the Antiatticist quotes twenty-five fragments from Sophocles as
against twelve taken from Euripides and four from Aeschylus.
Just as Euripides was for obvious reasons the favourite of the
anthologists, so Sophocles, not because of any preference based
on literary grounds, but owing to the character of his diction,
was the tragic model selected by the γραμματικοὶ.</p>

<p>The lexicons hitherto discussed were known among the <note type="marginal">Rhetorical lexicons.</note>
Byzantines as ‘rhetorical’ owing to their subservience to practical 
needs, but there is another class more properly so called
which had for its object the elucidation of the Attic orators.
We are chiefly concerned with Harpocration, whose ultimate
sources were the commentaries of Didymus1 on the orators, and
the Ἀτθίδες composed by various historians. He seems to have
employed immediately the same onomasticon which was epitomized 
in Bckker’s fifth lexicon2. Harpocration is usually
identified with the teacher of the emperor L. Verus, although
some authorities place him as early as the reign of Tiberius.
The citation of fr. 502 is the occasion of a remarkably puzzling
coincidence between Harpocration and Athenaeus. Both texts
have been confused by compression, but in a different way;
and, according to a recent explanation, it appears that the codex
of Harpocration was interpolated from Athenaeus at a time
when the Deipnosophists existed in a fuller form than is represented 
by the Marcianus3. Claudius Casilo, who, according to
Nauck's conjecture4, was a sophist of the fourth century, is
nearly related to Harpocration. The fragments published by
Miller from the Athous5 bear a close resemblance to the glosses
In the margin of the Cambridge Harpocration6, and it is possible
that Claudius Casilo, whoever he was, was also the editor of that
collection.</p>

was interpolated from Athenaeus, so that the authority of the latter's text
would be superior, it will be observed that on Schultz's hypothesis the accidental
substitution of ἄκραν for πέτραν may have been due to the epitomator of the Deiphosophists.</note>

ten books published between 166 and 176 A.D. is still extant,
was an Atticist of the milder type. He admitted much that
Aelius Dionysius and Phrynichus had rejected; for it was his
object to construct a complete vocabulary of Attic names
arranged according to subject-matter, But, while following the
precedent set by Telephus1 in his alphabetical περὶ Χρήσεως,

to aim not so much at comprehensiveness as at purity of
diction2. He made use of various sources in the composition
of the different books: in the preface to the seventh book he
speaks of the numerous writings, both verse and prose, which
he has consulted, and in those to the ninth and tenth books he
refers to the disappointing character of the information to be
gathered from the ὀνομαστικόν of Gorgias3 and the σκευοφορικός
of Eratosthenes. Thus in the second book he followed the
anatomical treatise of Rufus Ephesius4, and his close agreement
with Athenaeus in the passage from which fr. 241 is taken probably
indicates that Pollux drew from Juba's θεατρικὴ ἱστορία
or from the monograph περὶ αὺλῶν καὶ ἀπυάνων constituting the
third book of Tryphon's περὶ ὀνομασιῶν. The fragments of
Sophocles comprise some 36 for which Pollux is our sole
authority, and 15 in which he is supported by Hesychius either
alone or with others. Fr. 877 shows that the quotation ultimately
goes back to the common source of Pausanias and
Diogenian; in all probability to Didymus, whose influence can
be detected in regard to frs. II, 36, and 482. Fr. 89, if not also
fr. 734, goes back to Aristophanes of Byzantium; and the same
writer's work περὶ προσώπων was probably the source of Pollux

But another of his works, which was entitled περὶ πόλεων καὶ
οὒς ἑκάστη αὐτῶν ἐνδόξους ἤνεγκε in 30 books, is of much
greater importance, since it was the principal source followed
by Stephanus of Byzantium (c. 530 A.D.), who even in the extant
epitome of his ethnica mentions Philo's name 33 times. From
the fact that Apollodorus is mentioned by Stephanus 82 times
and Artemidorus about 801, it has been inferred that both were
extensively used by Herennius. To these authorities we should
at least add Hecataeus and Alexander Polyhistor, whose names
occur 300 and 100 times respectively. The position of Strabo
(cited 200 times) is more doubtful, since Herennius would have
no occasion to follow the copy when he had access to the
originals. Stephanus, of course, did not follow Herennius exclusively;
but in matters of etymology and προσῳδία had
recourse to Herodian (cited 80 times) and Ours (cited 14 times)2.
An examination of the context in which the quotations from
hocles occur, favours the conclusion that the majority
reached Stephanus through Herodian.</p>

has been enriched with numerous additions from other
sources, especially Aelius Dionysius, Phrynichus4, Harpocration,
and the lexicons to Homer and Plato. Photius announced that
his purpose in contrast with Diogenian was the collection of
λέξεις from prose writers, but in practice his quotations from the
poets are scarcely less numerous. The lexicon of Photius is
preserved only in the Cambridge codex Galeanus (XII cent.),
which is seriously mutilated, especially in the earlier part.
A certain portion of the early gaps has been supplied (a) from
the Athenian MS 1083, which contains two short fragments
published by Fredrich and Wentzel in 18965, and (b)
the Berlin MS (cod. Berol. graec. vet. 22) of the late eleventh or
early twelfth century, which contains the commencement of the
lexicon and extends as far as the gloss ἄπαρνος. The latter, so
far as it relates to Photius, was published by R. Reitzenstein in
1907 with the title Der Anfang des Lexicons des Photios. It has

centuries later the reviving interest in classical literature shown by
inent people, as well as generally by the church, led to the
appearance in successive redactions of encyclopaedic collections
in which etymology was a leading feature. The oldest of these,
known as the Etymologicum gtnuinum in accordance with the

similar sources. It appears in three distinct recensions repre
sented by various MSS1, and has a very complex history which
cannot be described here2. The Etymologicum Magnum, which
was edited by Gaisford in 1848, belongs to the early part of the
twelfth century. The author took as the basis of his work a copy
of the genuinum, which he describes as τὸ μέγα ἐτυμολογικόν,

Hellenic Studies for 19071 F. W. Hasluck published from an
inscription, which was found at Kermasti in the Cyzicus district
and is dated about 300 B.C., a long list of aphorisms, such as
φίλοις βοήθει, θυμοῦ κράτει, ἄδικα φεῦγε, and so forth,
intended for the moral edification of those who frequented the
immediate neighbourhood. When the list is compared with
the collection of the precepts of the Seven Wise Men attributed
to Sosiades in Stob. flor. 3. 80, it is abundantly clear that the
former, if not the original, is at any rate an early version of the
latter2 Even more remarkable in their relation to Stobaeus
were the fragments of florilegia published in Berl. Klassikertexte,
V 2 pp. 123—130, from two papyri (Berl. 9772 and 9773)
of the second century B.C. Thus 9773 not only contains the
extracts 9 and 11 of Stob. flor. 69 next to each other though in
the reverse order, but also the title ψόγος γυνικῶν which is
prefixed to the same chapter of Stobaeus. Though the text
of Stobaeus may thus be shown to depend upon very ancient
authority, it cannot be considered to possess the same weight as
the text of an extant play which can be traced to the Alexandrian
edition. In fact, when a comparison is possible between
the two, the differences are often such that they cannot entirely
be explained as the deliberate modifications of the anthologist
made for the purpose of adapting his quotations to their place.
In dealing with the Berlin fragments Wilamowitz suggested that
the text of Euripides might have come from a bad ’s copy,
while at the same time he pointed out the possibility that the
anthology was constituted before the date of Aristophanes
editin3. But, whatever the defects of his text, Stobaeus is so
precious a witness that one would willingly barter much of the
lexicographic material for an increased supply from the anthologies.
logies. In this respect Euripides was more fortunate, as has
already been mentioned. Apart from Stobaeus and his copyists
the only extant authority in this department is the ἀνθολόγιον

<p>§ 5. Bibliography.</p>
<p>The scholars of the centuries immediately following the
revival of learning were occupied with weightier matters than
the collection of the scattered remains of the ancient masters,
which the nature of the texts then available would have made
of exceptional difficulty. All the more credit is due to
ubon for constructing, by way of excursus to Athen. 277 E2,
a catalogue of all the titles of Sophocles' plays of which he could
find a record. Bentley once dreamed of the project of editing
the fragments of all the Greek poets, and the Letter to Mill and
the contributions to Graenius's Callimaclius were foretastes of
he might have accomplished in this sphere. but it
(??)til the latter part of the eithteenth century that attention
n to be directed to those of Sophocles in particular. In
Benjamin Heath (1704—1766) published at the Clarendon
cries of notes on Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Kuripides,
including (pp. 93—112) critical comments on a numb
igments taken from Grotius's excerpts from Stobaeus2.
ntribution of a similar kind was made by the well-known
philologer Jonathan Toup (1713—1785) in his Epistola Crittica
addressed to Warburton and published in 1767: and in the same
appeared L. Valckenaer's Diantribe in Euripidis A
dramatutn reliquias, which incidentally discussed se
Sophocles. Valckenaer had in fact devoted much
to these latter, and it is clear from the Preface of Brunck,
tor, that the collection contained in his edition
(1786) was largely indebted to the Dutch critic.

unedited lexicographical sources. The arrangement of the editio
princeps was somewhat inconvenient. The plays in alphabetica
order with most of the longer fragments attributed to them came
first; then more than ioo fragments ’ex incertis anc
lastly a number of glosses from the lexicographers arrangec
alphabetically as ‘Lexicon Sophocleum,” Sophocleum,’ and
lines as well as isolated words and phrases. Nevertheless
Brunck's edition, which was reprinted several times, held the
field for more than forty years, during which period little was
done either for the increase of the collection or for the better
understanding of the fragments which had been already printed
Mention should, however, be made of a paper by Blomfield in
Mus. Crit. Cant. 1 (1826)] 141—149, containing addenda to
Brunck's collection and critical notes on several passages
’s results were incorporated by W. Dindorf, who, in
his Poetae Scenici of 1830, was able by recasting Brunck's work
to issue it in a much more convenient form with various correction
and enlargements. Dindorf acknowledged in his Preface
that he had taken slight pains to improve the work by his ow
investigations, and lamented that there was no prospect of a new
edition adequate to the needs of the time. Hasty and superficia
as the book was, it shared the popularity which Dindorf's publi
cations enjoyed for about half a century, and in its latest form
as represented in the fifth and greatly improved issue of the
Poetae Scenici (1869), it is probably still in more general use
than any other edition.</p>
<p>A new epoch in the progress of knowledge concerning the
literary output of the Greek tragedians was opened by the
publication in three volumes of F. G. ’s Die grieckisch
Tragödien mit Rücksicht auf den epischen Cyclus geordnet,
1839. This was an exhaustive examination of all the evidence
which could be discovered bearing upon the literary history of
the plays of the three great tragedians, and especially on the
contents of their plots. The plays were arranged according to
the order occupied by the events which they comprised in the
series of the epic Cycle. Wecleker's book is as readable to-day
as when it was first printed. He had spared no exertion in
sifting the whole of the data provided by the mythographical

<pb n="xciii"/>
authorities, and in comparing them with the relevant indications
of the tragic fragments. On the basis of this evidence the plots
were reconstructed with remarkable acuteness; and the results,
though necessarily often conjectural, can be checked, even where
they fail to convince, by the openly displayed material of the
sources quoted. It should be added that the satyric plays had
been separately treated by Welcker in an earlier work entitled
Nachtrag zu die Aesch. Trilogic Prometheus, Frankfurt, 1826.
Welcker's work gave an extraordinary impulse to philological
activity, and the following years witnessed the appearance of
a number of critical papers in the various periodicals by Bergk.
eke, Nauck, Schneidewin, and others, directed to the emendation
and elucidation of the tragic texts. The influence of
Welcker is more directly visible in editions of the tragic fragments
which began to appear in the course of the following
decade. This applies to F. H. ’s Poetarum sccnicorum
m quorum integra opera supersunt Fragmenta, Lip
1844—1946 1, to F. W. Wagner's Poetarum tragicorum Graecorum
menta, Vratislaviae, 1844—1852, and to E. A. I. Ahrens's
edition of the fragments of Aeschylus and Sophocles in the
Didot scries (1842), which was prepared with the avowed object
of popularizing ’s results. J. A. ’s Sophokles
unite (1851) was a more ambitious effort upon the same
but his speculations, though sometimes ingenious, are
seldom such as to command absent.</p>
<p>In 1856 appeared the first edition of A. Nauck's Tragicorum
m Fragmtnta, which was the earliest systematic attempt
to produce an edition acceptable to the requirements of modern
criticism. His aim was critical rather than explanatory, and
if his chief merits was the provision of accurate information
concerning the textual data of the sources. Even where these
had not been satisfactorily edited, as was the case with Stobacus,
Nauck succeeded in procuring collations of the material readings
of the best MSS. ’s second edition, enlarged and revised
so as to include the lal ailable material, appeared in 1889,
<note type="footnote">1 In 1806 Bothe published an edition of Sophocles in 2 vols., in which the frag
menu were reproduced from Branck. A second edition appeared in 1826. Neither
r. work is of much independent value.</note>

<pb n="xciv"/>
and has remained the indispensable foundation of all subsequent
work. In the meantime Lewis Campbell had edited the fragments
after Nauck in the second volume of his Sophocles (1881),
excluding those which consist of single words or of very short
phrases. Campbell contributed some useful notes, but did little
to elucidate the difficulties which the fragments present; and he
evidently considered that they did not demand the same measure
of careful criticism which he applied to the text of the extant
plays.</p>
<p>In the course of the twenty-five years which have elapsed
since the appearance of Nauck's second edition a considerable
mass of fresh material has accrued, and the extraordinary
development of the various branches of Classical learning which
has taken place during that period, while it has thrown welcome
light on many obscurities, has enormously increased the difficulty
of focusing its results so far as they bear upon the scattered
texts. There has been no fresh edition of the whole of the
fragments; but, since the publication of the papyrus remains of
the Ichncutae and Euryphlus in 19 12, a convenient text entitled
Tragicorum Graecorum Fragmenta papyracea nuper reperta has
been edited by A. S. Hunt, andx the additions to Sophocles
brought to light in recent years have been collected and edited
by E. Diehl as Supplementum Soppocleum, Bonn, 1913. The
Ichneutae has been separately edited by N. Terzaghi, Firenze,
1913. 3. There is also a German translation by C. Robert, Berlin
[second ed.], 191 3. The following list contains all the occasional

<head>ΑΘΑΜΕ Α AND Β</head>
<p>There are two famous stories connected with the name of
Athamas, which are recorded by our authorities with great
variety of One of theses, these, the escape of Phrixus and
Helle. was the starting-point of the Argonautic saga; and,
though the evidence of the tragedians is the earliest to which
we can now appeal, it must have been related in the
Athamas, king of Thebes, by his union with Nephele,
an immortal, had two children, Phrixus and Helle. He subsequently
married Ino, who bore to him Lcarchus and Melicertes.
too MU jealous of the children of Nephele, and, when a drought
occurred—produced, according to one version, by the cunning
of Ino herself—she bribed the mi ra who sent by
Athamas to consult the oracle at Delphi, and persuaded them
to give a false report. They accordingly announced that the
god required the sacrifice of Phrixus as an expiation. Athamas
obliged against his will to consent, but Nephele succeeded
iving her children by means of a ram with a golden fleece,
whirl) Hermes gave to her. This ram, placed among the flocks
Athamas, mas, was not only endowed with the power of speech,
so that it was able to warn Phrixus of his impending danger,
but also rescued him and his sister by taking them on its back,
and flying away with them across the sea. Helle. unab
her seat, fell into the sea, and gave her name to the
espont; but Phrixus escaped to Colchis, lolchis, where he sacrificed
ram and presented its fleece to Aeetes. Such is the ge:
r of the mi verdions of Apollod. 83
h. fr. 37 (FHG 111 31), schol. rec. Aesch. Pers. 71.
and others; and there is some reason for
ripides made these events the basis of his ph
(TGF, P. 626), possibly with some of the variations recorded by
Hygin. fab. 2.</p>
<p>Sophcles wrote two plays entitled Athamas, and although
the fragments preserved are almost entirely insignificant, we
dire, evidence that one of them was omenied with a
version of the story given above. But the central incident in

<pb n="2"/>
Sophocles was not the rescue of Phrixus, but the subsequent
fate of Athamas. This appears from schol. V Ar. Nub. 257
(ὥσπερ με τὸν Ἀθάμανθ᾿ ὅπως μὴ θύσετε) τοῦτο πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον
Ἀθάμαντα Σοφοκλέους ἀποτεινόμενος λέγει. ὁ γάρ τοι Σοφοκῆς
πεποίηκε τὸν Ἀθάμαντα ἐστεφανωμένον καὶ παρεστῶτα τῷ βωμῷ
τοῦ Διὸς ὡς σφαγιασθησόμενον, καὶ μέλλοντος (-τα cod.) ἀποσφάττεσθαι
αὐτοῦ παραγενόμενον Ἡρακλέα, καὶ [τὸν] τοῦτον
θανάτου ῥυόμενον. The recent scholia, partly reproduced in
Apostol. 11. 58 (Paroem. 11 529 f.) under the lemma μὴ θεᾶς
ἄνθρωπον ὡς Ἀθάμας, add (1) that the punishment of Athamas
was brought about by Nephele on account of his conduct to
her children; (2) that Heracles saved Athamas by announcing
that Phrixus was alive. The latter point is also mentioned in
Suid. s.v. Ἀθάμας, who omits the reference to Sophocles. The
rejoinder of schol. R, to which some critics have attached too
much importance, is merely an ignorant objection: ὡς ἄγγροικος
Ἀθάμαντα εἶπεν ἀντὶ φρίξου· ἀντὶ τοῦ εἰπεῖν τὸν φρίξον τὸν
Ἀθάμαντα εἶπεν ὡς ἄγροικος ἀγνοῶν τὰς ἱστορίας· οὐ γὰρ
Ἀθάμς ἐφο&#x003C;νεύθη&#x003E;, ἀλλὰ φρίξος. For the tradition that
Athamas was sacrificed does not depend, which was current at
Alos in Thessaly, by Hdt. 7. 197. His narrative is not at all
clear, but so much at least is germane to the present discussion,
that Athamas was sacrificed καθαρμὸν τῆς χώρης ποιευμένων
Ἀχαιῶν ἐκ θεοπροπίου, and that Cytissorus the son of Phrixus
arrived from Colchis and rescued him. Several questions will
at once suggest themselves in reference to the dramatic treatment
which Sophocles may have applied to this material, but to
most of them no answer is possible. It is, however, a legitimate
observation that the means by which Nephele compassed the
sacrifice of Athamas, together with the arrival of Heracles, the
delivery of his message, and the release of Athamas, were amply
sufficient to occupy the whole of the action. I infer that the
history of the plot against Phrixus, with all its ἄλογα, although
ἐν τοῖς πράγμασιν, to use Aristotle's language (poet. 15. 1454b 7),
was nevertheless ἔξω τῆς τραγῳδίας. It seems to follow that
Athamas must have supposed Phrixus to be dead, although he
was not slain at the altar; and, since Helle actually perished,
that she cannot have been included in the design aimed at her
brother. The religious questions connected with the sacrifice of
Athamas, which are discussed by Frazer (Pausan. V p. 172) and
others, do not concern us here. The date of this play must
have been earlier than B.C. 423.</p>
<p>In the other story mentioned above Athamas was the
apparently innocent victim of the wrath of Hera. She afflicted

<pb n="3"/>
him with madness, because Hermes by the command of Zeus
had given Dionysus to Ino and Athamas to be reared as a girl:
see Hygin. fab. 5, Apollod. I. 84, 3. 28, Pausan. 1. 44. 7. The
was that Athamas, believing that he was hunting on
Cithaeron, mistook his elder son Learchus for a lion (or a stag)
and killed him with his spear; and that Ino, distraught with
frenzy and grief, took the other child Melicertes in her arms
and threw herself into the sea. Hence the proverb Ἰνοῦς ἄχη
in Zenob. 4. 38 and ’s flebilt Ino (A.P. 123). The story
can be traced to Phcrecydes (Schol. Horn. Σ 186: FHG 184);
and Seeliger (in Roscher I 670), and more doubtfully Escher
(in Pauly-Wissowa II 1931), identify it as the subject of the
second play of Sophocles1. Apart from the general probabilities
of the case, it is possible that frs. 2 and 9 refer to the delusion
of Athamas Ov. Met. 4. 420 ff. elaborates this version of the
story in his usual manner, but the following touches (512 ff.)
ir to be from his his Greek models: protinus Aeolides
1 furibundns in aula | clmat ‘io, contites, his retia
| hic modo cum getnina visa est tnihi prole leaena.’
and Tr. fr. adesp. 1 βρυαξούσης λεαίηνς, which may ju
well belong to Sophocles as to Aeschylus. Cf. Plut. de superst. 5.
c ὁ δ᾿ Ἀθάμας μείξονι (sc. ἐχρῆτο δυστυχίᾳ) καὶ ἡ
Βλέποντες (sc. τὰ κέκνα νει τοὺς συνήθεις) ώς
ἐλάφους. There is nothing to show whether Athamas

would precede his withdrawal to another country. for
which cf. Apollod. 1. 84. But none of these indications are so
strong as that of fr. 5, where we can hardly fail to see an allusion
to the miraculous power of Dionysus, Unless then the reference
to the influence of the god is be he explained by his nurture in
the palace of Athamas (cf Lucian dial. mar. 9. 1), 1. it would

Athamas who plotted the children of Ino as cruelly
as unsuccessfully as Ino had plotted against those of of Nepl

iame of Themisto was freely used by later writers as the

a reference to tragedies, may be an allusion to the playl of Sophocles.</note>

<pb n="4"/>
cause of the ruin of Athamas’ household : see Athen. 560 D,
Westermann Mythogr. p. 345. The evidence which connects
the play with the Dionysus-motive is clear enough, and allusions
to the madness of Athamas and to the final catastrophe may
fairly be inferred; but beyond this we cannot go. There is
nothing to show that the fragments of Accius’ Athamas can be
legitimately used to elucidate the plot of Sophocles1.</p>
<p>It should be observed that the progress of the Athamaslegend
shows the gradual combination of at least three stories,
which were originally entirely distinct, and belonged to different
localities. The subject cannot be pursued here; but an illustration
may be given from the fragment of Philostephanus (Schol.
AD Hom. H 86, cf. Pausan. 1. 44. 7), the pupil of Callimachus,
who omits the Bacchic influence entirely, and attributes the
death of Learchus to the retribution exacted by Athamas for
Ino’s treachery.</p>
<p>See also Introductory Note to the Phrixus.</p>
<p>Dindorf held that Ἀθάμας α΄ and β΄ were not separate plays,
but different editions of the same play. He applies the same
principle to other similar cases, but in the absence of specific
evidence of revision the presumption is strongly against him.</p>

<p>καταγνῶναι</p>
<p>1 Hesych. 11 p. 421 καταγνῶναι· ἐπιγνῶναι,
μέμψασθαι. Σοφοκλῆς Ἀθάμαντι
α΄.</p>
<p>A few lines before Hesych. has the
gloss αταγινώσκω· μέμφομαι. ἐπιγνῶναι
is added as an explanation, because the
sense ‘to find out’ was common in later
Greek: see e.g. Plut. Philop. 12 ἐπιγνωσθείσης
τῆς ἐπιβουλῆς. Thus καταγιγνώσκω
is, as observed by Neil on Ar.
Eq. 46 οὖτος καταγνοὺς τοῦ γέποντος τοὺς
τρόπους, ‘to find out to another's detriment,’
with various constructions. A
good Example is Thuc. 7. 51 κατεγνωκότων
ἤδη μηκέτι κρεισσόνων εἶναι, where the
inf. takes the place of the acc. of the thing.
It should be observed that καταγιγνώσκω
occasionally appears without the innuendo,
being precisely equivalent to ἐπιγιγνώσκω:
Xen. Oec. 2. 18 καὶ θᾶττον καὶ ῥᾷον καὶ
κερδαλεώτερον κατέγνων πράττοντας.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>ἕρκεσι</p>
<p>2 Hesych. ΙΙ p. 192 ἕρκεσι· δικτύοις.
Σοφοκλῆς Ἀθάμαντι β΄. The same gloss
occurs in Phot. lex. p. 14, 12 without the
name of author or Play.</p>
<p>Cf. Etym. M. p. 375, 10 ἕρκος...σημαίνει
καὶ τὰ δίκτυα ὡς τό ὅτε δὴ παρὰ λίνου ἕρκει 
ἐνιπλήξωσι (a confused quotation of Hom.
χ 468). The same sense occurs in fr. 431,
Ar. Av. 528 ἕρκη, νεφέλας, δίκτυα, πηκτάς,
Pind. Pyth. 2. 80 φελλὸς ὣς ὑπὲρ ἕρκος.
For a possible explanation οf the allusion
see Introductory Note.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 The conjectures that have been made as to Accius’ sources are mutually destructive.
It is now thought (Escher in Pauly-Wissowa II 1933) that his play play comprised
the material of Hygin. poet. astr. 2. 20, which Sophocles may have used in the Phrikus.</note>

παιδιά, χλεύη. ἔφοδος· ἀπὸ τοῦ ἕπεσθαι.
ὁμιλία. Σοφοκλῆς Ἀθάμαντι δευτέρῳ.</p>
<p>Outside the lexicographers, the word
seems only to occur in Nic. Ther. 880
σπέρμ᾿ ὀλοὸν κνίδης, ἤθ᾿ ἐψίη ἔπλετο κούροις,
where the schol. explains it by παίγνιον.
The verb ἕψιᾶσθαι, with its compounds
ἐφ-καθ-and ἀφεψιᾶσθαι (fr. 138).
is somewhat more common. There are also
to be taken into account the gloss ἀψίαι·
ἑορταί. Λάκωνε (Hesych. I p. 347) and
the compounds φιλέψιος (a proper name
in Ar. Plut. 177, where see schol.), προσεψιά
(Hesych.). The history of this
obscure and obsolete word was much
canvassed by the grammarians, although
there is a general agreement as to its
meaning (‘amusement’). The authority
whom Hesychius follows derived it from
ἔπεσθαι tracing the transition (ἔφοδος) of
the meaning to παιδιά by way of ὁμιλία:
for the transferred sense of ἔφοδος (=means
of passing), not clearly recognised by L.
and S., see Plut. mor. 1055 F, Diog. L. 6.</p>
<p>31. There was, howerer, some wavering
as to the breathing; and on this account
an alternative derivaton from ἔπος was propounded:
schol. Ap. Rhod. 1. 459 ἐψιόωνται.
παρὰ τὴν ἐψίαν, ἤ ἐστι διὰ λόγων
παιδιά· οἷον ἐπεσία τις οὖσα· παρὰ τὸ ἔποτ.
διὸ καὶ ψιλοῦται, ὁτὲ δασύνεται, ἀντὶ τοῦ
ἀκολουθοῦσιν. So φιλέψιος was distinguished
as meaning φιλοπαίγμων or φιλόλογος,
according as the second syllable
was or was not aspirated (Etym. M. P.
406, 8, Suid. s v. ἐψία). Some modern
scholars have favoured the view that ἐ-is
prothetic, and that the word is to be connected
with ψιάδδοντι=ludunt, in Ar. Lys.
1302: this was adopted by Curtius (G. E.
11 p. 394 E. tr.) who however forbore to
speculate on the derivation. Lobeck's
(Path. El. 1 52) notion that ἐψία was ‘a
game played with pebbles’ rests on the
assumption that ψιά was another form of
στία. Monro on Hom. ρ 530 takes and
entirely different line, holding that ἐψιάομαι
‘implies a noun ἔψις, from  a root ἐπ-,
Indog. ieq. seen in Lat. iocus.</p>

the silvery grey of dawn in contrast to the

usage, which is found also in Latin :
Catull. 8. 3 fulsere quondam candidi tibi
soles, as contrasted with Hor. Sat. 1.9. 72
huncine solem tam nigrum surrexe mihi!
There is no need to seek for any artificial
explanation, such as that which Suidas
(s.vv. λευκὴ ἡμέρα, τῶν εἰς φαρέτραν)
quotes from Philarchus (FHG 1 355),
based on an alleged custom of the
Scythians to put a white stone into their
quiver at night-time for a day spent
happily, or a black in the other event.
Plin. n. h. 7. 40 tells a similar story of
the Thracians, and some such practice is
alluded to in Hor. C. 1. 36. 10. Pers. 2. 1,
Catull. 68. 148. Plin. ep. 6. 11. Plutarch
gives another explanation, relating that
Pericles during the blockade of Samos
allowed such of his soldiers as drew by
lot a white bean 1ο be relieved from
discipline and enjoy themselves as they
pleased : διὸ καί φασι τοὺς ἐν εὑπαθείαις
τισὶ γιγνομένους λευκὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην ἁπὸ
τοῦ λευκοῦ κυάμου προσαγορεύειν (Per. 27).
Is it merely a coincidence that Eupolis in
the Κόλακες referred to this siege (fr. 154
1 299 K.)? Horace speaks of Genius
as albus et ater (Ep. 2. 2. 189), i.e. εὐδαίμων
or the reverse.</p>

πυργήρης, ἀμφήρης and others. Τ history
of some of these words is not free from
doubt, but the force of ηρης as an element
of composition seems to have been reduced,
so that in the time of the tragedians it had
become productive as a merely adjectival

<p>ΑΙΑΣ ΛΟΚΡΟΣ</p>
<p>Ajax, Ὀιλῆος ταχὺς υἱός, is introduced in Horn. B 527 as
leader of the Locrians who dwelt opposite to the coast of
Euboea. He is often mentioned in the Iliad in conjunction
with the Telamonian Ajax ; and, though inferior in strength
as compared with his namesake, is nevertheless a distinguished
warrior who comes especially into prominence at the battle round
the wall (N 46). The circumstances of his death are related in
8 499 ff. He was one of the victims of the storm which overtook
the Greeks on their return from Troy, and, when landing on the
rocks at Myconus known as the Gyrae, was hurled back into
the sea by Poseidon and drowned, in punishment for a boastful
speech that he needed no divine aid to escape. Homer says
that he was ἐχθόμενος Ἀθήνῃ, without explaining the reason ;
but, if we accept the explanation of Strabo (600), this merely
implies that he was involved in the common fate which befel
the Greeks for abusing their victory in the sack of Troy.
Homer, he says, has not mentioned any outrage committed
against Cassandra, and knows nothing of her violation by Ajax.
Yet, even in Homer, the character of Ajax showed traces of a
cruel and savage disposition, and his arrogant contempt for the
gods led to his destruction. It is clear, however, that an act of
sacrilegious violence committed by him was described in the
Iliupersis 1 : see Proclus chrestom. (EGF p. 49) Kaaraavhpav
δὲ Αἴας Ὀλέως πρὸς βίαν ἀποσπῶν συνεφέλκεται τὸ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς

τὸν Αἴαντα. ὂ δὲ ὲπὶ τὸν τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς Βωμὸν καταφεύγει, καὶ
διασώζεται ἐκ τοῦ ἐπικειμένου κινδύνου. To the latter part of
this corresponds Apollod. epit. 5. 25 ὡς δὲ ἔμελλον ἀποπλεῖν
πορθήσαντες Τροίαν, ὑπὸ Κάλχαντος κατείχοντο, μηνίειν Ἀθηνᾶν

Horn. 7 135. Welcker (p. 162) rightly observed that the Homeric
story does not seem capable of dramatic treatment ; but in the
extracts just quoted the possibility of a tragic conflict is manifest.
It can hardly be doubted that we have here part of the frame-

work of the Sophoclean plot, more especially as the account
of Apollodorus explains Eur. Tro. 69—71 : ΑΘ. οὐκ οἶσθ᾿
ὑβρισθεῖσάν με καὶ ναοὺς ἐμούς; | ΠΟ. οἶδ᾿ ἡνίκ᾿ Αἴας εἶλκε
Κασανδραν βίᾳ |ΑΘ. κοὐδέν γ᾿ Ἀχαιῶν ἔπαθεν οὐδ᾿ ἤκουσ᾿
Further details are given by Pausanias in his description
of the painting by Polygnotus in the Lesche at Delphi (10. 26. 3):
‘Ajax the son of Oilcus stands by the altar with his shield,
taking an oath concerning the outrage on Cassandra; while
Cassandra is seated οn the ground clasping the image of
Αthena, as it seems that she overturned it from its pedestal,
when Ajax dragged her from the sanctuary.’ Robert (Die
Iliupersis, p. 63) thinks that Ajax was swearing to atone for
his crime by sending two Locrian maidens annually to the
temple of Athena at Troy. He thus connects the oath with
the temple-story (Toepffer in Pauly-Wissowa 1 938) which
sought to explain the historical custom by reference to a heroic
legend. The chief authorities for the Locrian tribute, which
lasted until shortly before the time of Plutarch, are Timaeus
ap. Tzeti Lycophr. 1141 (FHG 1 207), and Callimachus ap.
schol. AD Hom. N 66 (II 125 Schneider). See also Holzinger
on Lycophr. 1153. But Robert’s explanation of the oath taken
by Ajax is somewhat far-fetched, and it is simpler to suppose
that there is. a reference to the exculpatory oath which is
prescribed as a mode οf trial by primitive systems of jurisprudence:
see Wyse on Isae. 12. 9. In any case, the trial of
Ajax before the council of elders provided an occasion for a
formal debate (λόγων ἀγών) such as the tragedians loved. It
is sometimes stated (as by Toepffer u.s.) that the erotic motive
and the violation of the priestess did not belong to the original
story, but were the invention of later writers (e.g. Dio Chrys.
11. 153). The conclusion is questionable; and it is worth notice
that Apollod. epit. 5. 22 Αἴας δὲ ὁ Λοκρὸς Κασάνδραν όρῶν
περιπεπλεγμένην τῷ ξοάνῳ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς βιάζεται· διὰ τοῦτο τὸ
ξόανον εἰς οὐρανὸν βλέπειν, which is believed to derive from epic
sources, agrees exactly in its account of the miraculous aversion
of the gaze of the image with Lycophr. 316 f. (cf. Strabo 264).
The early appearance of the motive is also attested by Theogn.
1223 f. ὤλετο δ᾿ Αἰγείδης Θησεὺς μέγας ?λετο δ᾿ Αἴας | ἐσθλὸς
Ὀιλιάδης σῇσιν (sc. Ἔρωτος) ἀτασθαλίαις. as well as by the
evidence of early vase-paintings collected by Furtwängler and
Reichhold, Griech. Vasenmal. München 1904, 1 p. 185, and
summarized by Gruppe in Bursians Jahresb. CXXXVII 387.</p>
<p>The effect of the above discussion is to determine the
outlines of the story as known to Sophocles: we are still as
far as ever from being able to fill in the details, or to trace the

<pb n="10"/>
process by which the tragic περιπέτεια resulted. No boubt the 
outrage in the temple was outside the action of the play, and
the two chief moments that fell within the time convered by it 
were the acquittal of Ajax by the Achaeans, and his subsequent 
death at Gyrae. It was impossible for the latter to be enacted
on the stage, and it must either have been related by a messenger 
or foretold by a god. The former alternative is clearly to be 
preferred, but involves the assumption that Ajax sailed before 
the rest of the Greeks, and that his death was reported at Ilion
before the other characters in the play had started. It is more 
difficult to conjecture how the acquittal of Ajax was procured.</p>
<p>A possible suggestion, based on the lawless character of the
accused and the oath mentioned by Pausanias, would be that 
he escaped death by a brazen act of perjury, but was required
as being ceremonially unclean to withdraw from the rest of the army.
The retribution of the offended deities was not long in 
coming; but even so the shadow of impending disagster hung 
over those who had connived at the crime of Ajax. It may be 
inferred from Pausan. 10. 31. 2 that the chief opponent of Ajax
was Odysseus.</p>
<p>The version of the story adopted by Philostr. heroic. 9
presents certain fetures which suggest a dramatic origin,
although we have no means of identifying it.</p>
<p>According to this, Ajax dragged Cassandra from the temple, 
but offered no violence to her, and kept her in his tent.
Agamemnon saw the girl, fell in love with her, and took her from Ajax.
When the spoils were divided, Ajax claimed her,
but Agamemnon refused to give her up and accused Ajax of
sacrilege. In order to excite odium against Ajax, he also caused 
a rumour to be spread through the camp that Athena was 
incensed in consequence of the outrage, and woulddestroy the 
army unless Ajax were put to death. But Ajax, fearing injustice
and oppression, if he submitted himself to trial, secretly withdrew
by night in a small boat and was drowned off Gyrae.</p>
<p>From lucian de salt. 46 καθ' ἕκαστον γοῦν τῶν ἐκεῖ  (i.e. at
Trov) πεσόντων δρᾶμα τῇ σκηνῇ πρόκειται . . . ἡ κατὰ Παλαμήδους 
ἐπιβουλὴ καὶ ἡ Ναυπλίου ὀργὴ καὶ ἡ Αἴαντος μανία καὶ ἡ θατέρου 
ἐν ταῖς πέτραις ἀπώλεια, Nauck is justified in inferring an 
allusion to the present play. Hygin. fab. 116 cannot be used in
support of Hartung's view that the story of Nauplius was combined
with that of the Locrian Ajax in a single tragedy.

in an abridged form in Suid. s. v. σπολάς,
and v. 2 is quoted by Pollux 7. 70 without 
the name of the play.</p>
<p>2 σπολάς may be conveniently rendered
'jerkin.' Pollux (i.e.) speaks of it
as a leathern cuirass, fastened at the 
shoulders, and Photius (lex. p. 531, 17) as
δερμάτιον ἐφαπτῶδες, suitable for use in 
war. It is sometimes described as χιτών,
as by Euphronius and Hesych.;  but the 
distinction (παρήχθη), according to the schol.'s suggestion, lay in the mode of
attachment, since a leather coat could 
not be strapped with a girdle.—παρδληφόρον 
δέρος. L. and S. give παρδαλήφορον 
and are followed by Campbell, who 
renders 'the hide the leopard wore,' as 
if it could be assumed at will. So also 
Blaydes, who however suspects that we 
should read παρδαλῆς στικτὸν δέρος and 
eject καταστίκτου κυνὸς as a gloss. But 
this is contrary to all analogy, and there 
is no more difficulty in the transference 
of the epithet than e.g. in κερασφόρους 
στόρθυγγας fr. 89, ξιφηφόρους ἀγῶνας 
Aesch. Cho 582 or κισσοφόροις ἐν θαλίαις 
Eur. Bacch. 384. Much confusion in the
treatment of compounds would be avoided, 
if critiecs would pay more attention to the 
simple and logical methods of the Sanskrit 
grammarians:  see Peile, Notes on Tale of 
Nala p. 3 ff., Brugmann Comp. Gr. 11

<p>The reference is to the leopard-skin 
hung outside the house of Antenor, in 
order that  -it might be idetified and 
spard when the Greeks entered Troy: 
see Strab. 608, a passage to be quoted in 
connexion with the Antenoridae. Hartung 
thinks that our fragment actually came 
from the last-named play and is wrongly 
attributed to the locrian  Ajax, but the incident might well have been mentioned 
in a play which was so closely concerned
with the circumstances of the sack of the 
city,—perhaps, as Wagner suggests, in
the speech of Cassandra accusing Ajax.</p>

om. S) ‘ἄνθρωπός . . . μόνον.’ The line is 
referred to this play, as not being extant 
in the Ajax;  but it is not unlikely, as 
Dindorf  and van Leeuwen suggested,
that the ascription Αἴαντι is an error.
Τhe latter thought that Αἴαντι was due to 
a slip of memory on the part of the 
anthologist, who had in mind Ai. 125,
and that the true source of the quotation 
cannot be ascertained (de Ai. Soph.
authentia, p. 119).</p>
<p>The epigram marks by two images the 
emptiness and unreality of human life: 
‘Vanity of nanities, saith the Preacher.’
In eccl. 1. 14 the R.V. has ‘all is vanity
and a striving after wind’ (προαίρεσις πνεύματος
LXX). But πνεῦμα is rarely used
in this connexion, mere breath without
any substance: cf. Phoenix Coloph. ap.
Athen. 6530 F ἐγὼ Νίνος πάλαι ποτ' ἐγενόμην 
πνεῦμα, | νῦν δ' οὐκ ἔτ' οὐδέν, ἀλλὰ

things variable: Suid. s. v. ἀνέμου παιδίον,
Eupolis fr. 376 (1 358 K.) ἄνεμος καὶ 
ὄλεθρος ἄνθρωπος.—σκιά, of things unsubstantial,
is common: fr. 945. Eur. fr. 509

is emphasised by some addition: fr. 659,

<p>14</p>
<lg><l>σοφοὶ τύραννοι τῶν σοφῶν ζυνουσίᾳ.</l></lg>
<p>14 The verse is assigned to Sophocles 
by Libanius epist. 33. A fuller tradition 
gives the name of the play and discusses 
Plato's error:  Zenob. 5. 98 (Miller, Mélanges,
p. 363; Crusius, Anal. p. 153) τοῦτο 
Σοφοκλέους ἐστὶν ἐξ Αἴαντος τοῦ Λοκροῦ.
Πλάτων δέ φησιν Εὐριπίδου εἶναι τὸ ἰαμβεῖον. 
και οὐδὲν θαυμαστόν· συμπίπτουσι 
γὰρ ἀλλήλοις οἱ ποιηταί. This is almost
identical with schol. Plat. rep. 568 A.
The schol. on Ar. Thesnt. 21 adds that 
Aristophanes in the Ἥρωες (fr. 308 1 471 
K.) distinctly attributed the line to 
Euripides, and that Antisthenes as well as
Plato did the same; he is quite at a lsos
to account for the confusion, but mentions 
the view of some (ὤσπερ ὑπονοοῦσί τινες) 
that the two poets by a coincidence hit on 


<pb n="13"/>
the same line. See also Aristid. 11 p. 373
Dind., who treats Plato's view as an error,
and Aul. Gell. 13. 19. 1, 2ho adds to the 
confusion by substituting the Theaetetus for 
the Theages as the dialogue containing the 
misquotation. On the other hand, Plato's 
attribution to Euripids is accepted by 
Stob. flor. 48 5 (IV p. 251, 10 Hense),
and hesitatingly by Themist. p. 72 C Eὐριπίδης
ἢ ὄστις δή ποτέ ἐστιν ὁ ποιήσας. 
Several late authorities, references to 
which will be found in Nauck, cite the 
line without giving the name of any 
author.</p>
<p>The circumstances detailed above raise 
a curious literary question, viz. why Plato 
(in Theag. 125 B and rep. 568 A) assigned
a lilne to Euripides which was in fact 
written by Sophocles. We may leave out 
of account the possibility of coincidence, 
although Didymus is thought to have 
been responsible for this suggestion in 
criticising Aristophanes  of Byzantium,
who gave this v. as an instance of κλοπή
(Nauck, Arist. Byz. p. 280). It is possible
but not very likely that one poet was 
quoting from the other; so that nan error,
rendered still more remarkable from the 
fact that it was common also to Aristophanes 
and Antisthenes, is the only 
supposition remaining which will account 
for the facts. Adam (on rep. 568 A),
while pointing out that such an error was 
more likely to take place in ancient times
than it would be now, thaks that the
cant use of σοφός in Euripides made it all 
the easier.</p>
<p>The point of the line is that kings 
profit by the discourse of the wise men 
who flock to their courts. The typical instance 
is that of Simonides, who sojourned
successively at the courts of Hippias,
Scopas, and Hiero. Aristotle relates the 
anecdote that Simonides, questioned by 
Hiero's wife whether it is better to be wise or rich, replied in favour of the latter, 
on the ground that he was accustomed to 
see wise men spending their time at the 
gates of the rich (rhet. 2. 16 1391a 8 ff.).
Poets are often called σοφοί in respect of 
their technical skill, but Simonides had 
considerable reputation a a moralist, and 
in the capacity he appears as giving advice 
to Hiero in Xeophon's dialogue of that 
name:  cf. [Plat.]  epist. 2 περὶ Ἱέρωνος 
ὄταν διαλέγωνται οἰ ἄνθρωποι καὶ Πανσανίου 
τοῦ Λακεδαιμονίου, χαίρουσι τὴν 
Σιμωνίδου ξυνουσίαν παραφέροντες ἄ τε 
ἔπραξε καὶ εἴπε πρὸς αὐτούς. Cf. generally

<p>15</p>
<lg><l>τί σοι ὁ Ἀπόλλων κεκιθάρικεν;</l></lg>
<p>15 τίσιν Μacar. |  ἐιθάρισεν Plut.</p>
<p>15 Ζenob. 6. 14 (Miller, Mélanges,
p. 370): ‘τί σοι ὀ Ἀπόλλων κεκιθάρικεν;’
τὸ ‘κεκιθάρικεν’ οἶον ἐμαντεύσατο· ὤς 
φησιν Αἰσχύλος ἐν Αἴαντι Λοκρῷ. Suid.
s.v.: ‘τί σοι ὁ Ἀπόλλων κεκιθάρικεν;’ ἀντὶ 
τοῦ τί σοι ἐμαντεύσατο. Τo the same effect 
Plut. prov. 1. 7, and Macar. 8. 37.
Dindorf recognized that Αἰσχύλος was a 
mistake for Σοφοκλῆς, as the former did 
not write a play entitled αἴας Λοκρός.
Nauck suggested that the quotation should 
begin τί σοὶ δ' Ἀπόλλων, which is at least 
more metrical. It is generally considered
that κεκιθάρικεν is corrupt on the ground
that oracles at Delphi were delivered by 
the voice of the Pythia, which is identified 
with that of the god:  H., who thinks that
either the reading or the explanati9on must 
be wrong, refers to Ar. Plut. 39 τί δῆτα 
Φοῖβος ἔλακεν ἐκ τῶν στεμμάτων; Hence
Meineke (Theocr.3 p. 463) conjectured τί 
δῆτ' Ἀπόλλων σοι τεθρίακεν (cf. fr. 466),
and Nauck, following him, ἐντεθρίακεν
(coll. Hesych. II p. 108), which Dindorf 
approved. Cobet (Coll. Crit. p. 187), who 
says  ‘nihil horum est Sophocle dignum
οὐδ' ἐγγύς,’ actually proposes to read τί 
δῆθ' ὁ Φοῖβος ἔλακιν; I do not share these 
doubts. The harp and the bow are 
mentioned together with the prophetic
function as the chief prerogatives of Apollo
in Hom. h. Ap. 131 εἴη μοι κίθαρίς  τε 
φίλη καὶ καμπύλα τόξα, | χρήσω δ' ἀνθρώποισι 
Διδς νημερτέα βουλήν, where Gemoll
quotes Callim. h. Ap. 44 Φοίβῳ γὰρ καὶ 
τόξον ἐπιτρέπιται καὶ ἀοιδή, | κείνου δὲ 
Θριαὶ καὶ μάντιες. His oracles were 
ἔμμιτρα and μέλη, and as such properly 
accompaied by the κίθαρις, and referred 
to the god of musci and song:  see Gruppe,
Gr. Myth. p. p. 1253. This connexion is
explicitly acknowledged by Plutarch: 

<pb n="14"/> 
Pyth. or. 5 p. 396 C καίτοι μουσηγέτης ὁ 
θεός, καὶ τῆς λεγομένης λογιότητος οὐχ
ἦττον αὐτῷ καλὸν ἢ τῆς περὶ μέλη καὶ ᾠδὰς

δὴ μεμψόμεθα τὴν Πυθίαν, ὅτι Γλαύκης οὐ 
φθέγγεται τῆς κιθαρῳδοῦ λιγυρώτερον.
If the Pythia was κιθαρῳδός, it is not surprising that Apollo, who was represented in art both as κιθριστής and 
κιθαρῳδός, should be said  κιθαρίζειν in his 
mantic capacity. The citharoede is the 
interpreter of the citharist, as the προφήτης 
interpreter the μάντις. Cf. Pind. fr. 150 (of
the muse of the poet) μαντεύεο Μοῖσα, 
προιφατεύσω δ' ἐγώ.—Blaydes conjectured

<lg><l>καὶ πεζὰ καὶ φορμικτά </l></lg>
<p>16 Schol. Eur. Alc. 446 οὐρείαν χέλυν]
. . .τουτέστι μετὰ λύρας. καὶ παρὰ Σοφοκλεῖ 
ἐν Αἴαντι Λοκρῷ ‘καὶ πεζα καὶ φορμικτά.’ 
This is usually regarded as the only extant 
example of the word πεζός being applied 
to rhythmical verse unacconipanied by 
music. But the smae use actually occurs 
in Plat. soph. 237 A ἀρχόμενος δὲ καὶ διὰ 
τέλους τοῦτο ἀπεμαρτύρατο (Παρμενίδης) 
πεζῇ τε ὦδε ἑκάστοτε λέγων καὶ μετὰ 
μέτρων· οὐ γὰρ μήποτε τοῦτο δαμῇ, φησίν,
κτέ, (fr. 7 D), where the commentators unnecessarily
suppose that oral teaching is 
referred to. Nor is there any reason why 
we should interpret otherwise Com. fr.
adesp. 601 111 516 K. παῦσαι μελῳδοῦσ’.
ἀλλὰ πεζῇ μοι φράσον, or the gloss of Phot.
lex. p. 405, 17 πεζῷ γόῳ· ἄνευ αὐλοῦ ἢ 
λύρας. The meaning here is perfectly 
clear, though Campbel seems inclined 
to think that the word may have its common 
later sense of prose;  for the passage
of Sophocles was quoted to illustrate the 
text of Euripides which proceeds μέλψουσι 
καθ' ἑπτάτονόν τ' ὀρείαν | χέλυν, ἔν τ' ἀλύροις
κλέοντες ὔμνοις, and the critics are no doubt 
right in referring the later words to the 
rhapsodists. Thus πεζά (ἔπη) is the same 
as Plato's ψιλὴ ποίησις (Phaedr. 278 C), or
μαθήματα ἄλυρα ποιητῶν κείμενα ἐν 
γράμμασι, τοῖς μὲν μετὰ μέτρων (legg. 810 B),
and Aristotle's ψιλομετρία (poet. 2 1448a
10), The schol. adds a pertinent illustration 
(see also Phot. lex. s. uv. πεζὰς 
μόσχους and πεζῇ, and Etym. M. p. 658,
36), according to which the adjective was 
jestingly applied to hetaerae: καὶ πεζαὶ δέ 
τινες ἑταῖραι λέγονται, αἳ χωρὶς ὀργάνου εἰς 
τὰ συμπόσια φοιτῶσιν.</p> 
<p>Blaydes suggests φορμιγκτά, comparing 
σαλπιγκτής: but Meisterhans3 p. 84 shows
that inscriptions always have σαλπικτής.</p>
<p>17</p>
<lg><l>Ἑλλάς </l></lg>
<p>17 Antiatt. (Bekk. anecd.) p. 97, 4
Ἑλλάς· ὁ ἀνήρ. Σοφοκλῆς Αἴαντι Λοκρῷ. Η.
shows that this is an error of the Antiatticist,
in which he does not stand alone. Ἑλλάς 
is a fem, adjective similar to πεδιάς, ὀργάς,
Τρῳάς, Ἀσιάς, Φθιάς, Ἀττική, and so 
forth; and it is difficult to believe without 
definite proof that it was used for Ἕλλην.
The cause of the misunderstanding apperars
to have been taht οὔθ' Ἑλλὰς οὔτε 
βάρβαρος or τίς Ἑλλὰς ἢ βάρβαρος, with or 
without γῆ, were phrases commonly employed: 
Dem. 9. 27 οὔθ' ἡ Ἑλλὰς οὔθ' ἡ 
βάρβαρος τὴν πλεονεξίαν χωρεἲ. Μax.
Tyr. 6. 3  εἴ που καὶ γένοιτο τῆς Ἑλλάδος  ἢ
τῆς βαρβάρου γῆς. The transition to the idea 
of a person is found in Trach. 1060 
οὔθ' Ελλὰς οὔτ' ἄγλωσσος οὔθ' ὄσην ἐγὼ|
γαῖαν καθαίρων ἱκόμην ἔδρασέ πω, | γυνὴ
δέ . . ., where ἄγλωσσος is a synonym for 
βάρβαρος (Pind. Isth. 6. 24 οὔδ' ἔστιν οὕτω 
βάρβαρος οὔτε παλίγγλωσσος πόλις). Here
it is evident that what is to be understood 
with Ἑλλάς is γαῖα, but since the meaning
is no inhabitant of such a land, the transition to a person is easy. So in Eur.
Phoen. 1509 τίς Ἑλλὰς ἢ βάρβαρος ἢ τῶν 
προπάροιθ' εὐγενετᾶν ἔτερος ἔτλα . . .;
although we pass to ἔτερος, we shall hardly
doubt that τίς Ἑλλὰς = ‘what Hellene
land?' Yet there tbhe scholiasts vary:  one
rightly says τίς Ἑλληνικὴ γῆ, another has 
τίς Ἑλληνικὴ ἢ βάρβαρος, δηλονότι γυνή,
another ἤγουν τίς τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἢ Ἕλλην 
ἢ βάρβαρος, yet another, γρ. τίς Ἕλλην.</p>

κατὰ διαίρεσιν καὶ φανερῶς· ἤ ύπομερίζων
καὶ διαβάλλων (διαλαμβάνων conj. Nauck)
ὡς Σοφοκλῆς Αἴαντι φάσκων ‘δατούμενος’.
τὸ γὰρ αὐτὸ δύναται.</p>
<p>Schneidewin (Coni. Crit. p. 102) concluded
that the scholiast had made a
mistake, and that the passage which he
really had in his mind was Trach. 791 τὸ
δυσπάρευνον λέκτρον ἐνδατούμενος | σοῦ τῆς
ταλαίης. Dindorf was of the same
opinion; but their inference is too hasty.
There is no reason why Sophocles should
not have used δατούμενος in the same
sense as ἐνδατούμενος; and we have no
sufficient ground for suspecting the scholiast
of a double error. The metaphor in
ἐνθατεῖσθαι is clearly explained by the
shol. on Trach. l.c. σφοδρῶς λοιδορούμενος·
ἐνδατεῖσθαι γὰρ σφοδρῶς ἐσθίειν.
λοιδορῶν, μεμφόμενος, κατὰ μέρος τῶν
λεγομένων ἀνακαλῶν· ἐνδατεῖσθαι γὰρ τὸ
μερίσασθαι, ἠ δὲ μεταφορὰ ἀπὸ τῶν δαινυμένων.
To the same effect but more
briefly Hesych. II p. 89 ἐνδατεῖται· ἀπομερίζει
(1.	ὑπομερίζει). . .ἐνδατούμενος· μεριζόμενος
καὶ οἱονεὶ κακῶς λέγων σφοδρῶς.
ἀπὸ τῆς δαιτός. [These extracts show
clearly that Nauck was wrong in conjecturing
διαλαμβάνων in schol. Aeschin.
The annotators there doubted whether
διαιρούμενος meant ‘accurately defining’ or
‘dividing up and so censuring,‘ and quoted
δατούμενος in Soph. in support of the 
latter view. The words of the scholiast,
as printed in Dindorf’s  Poet. Seenici, are
unintelligible, owing to a strange dislocation
of their order. There is no variation
in the MSS. except that cod. F does not
contain the second part of the note.]
Lycophr. 155 τὸν ὡλενίτην χόνδρον ἐνδατουμένη,
‘chewing the shoulder muscles,’
testifies to the literal meaning. Hence.
throught the ideas of repetition and insistence,
is developed the metaphorical
sense of ‘to dwell upon,’ as applied to
abstract ideas or to speech: see Verrall
notion of blame is not essential to the
figurative meaning of ἐνδατεῖσθαι, and the
same was probably true of the simple
verb, although the evidence is defective.
The Latin phrases differre or discerpere
dictis, like our ‘to pick to pieces,’ arose
in a different way: cf. διαςύρω. Observe
also that the English ‘to mince’ acquired
the sense of ‘to depreciate (a matter)’ by
yet another course of development.</p>
<p>ΑΙΓΕΥΣ</p>
<p>Casaubon on Athen. 122 F seems to have thought that the
early adventure of Aegeus at Troezen related in Plut. Thes. 3
was the subject-matter of Sophocles’ play. But, as Welcker
(p. 394) remarks, the material is only sufficient for the beginning
of a tragedy. Of the six fragments which are cited from the
play four clearly refer to the journey made by Theseus to
Athens for the purpose of discovering his father, and the dangers
which he encountered before his identity was established. This
fact leaves little doubt as to the period covered by the story,
and makes it probable that the ἀναγνώρισις of Theseus formed
the climax of the action rather than the death of Aegeus after
the return from Crete. It is thus impossible to agree with
Wenicked (in Pauly-Wissowa 1 954) that the contents of this


<pb n="16"/>
play are entirely unknown; and it rather appears that Ahrens
was right in supposing that the plot was similar to that of the 
Euripidean Aegeus, which culminated in the recognition of
Theseus and the discomfiture of Medea (Plut. Thes. 12). But
the new fragment (fr. 25) relating to the capture of the Marathonian
bull is of peculiar importance, as showing that in
Sophocles this adventure preceded the recognition. instead of
occurring at a later period according to the account of Plutarch
(Thes. 14). In the Hecale of Callimachus it happened in the
lifetime of Aegeus, but was subsequent (it would seem) to the
recognition: see Cl. Rev. VII 429 Θησεὺς οὐχ ἑκὰς υἱὸς ἀπ’
εὐύδρου Μαρθῶνος |ζωὸν ἄγων τὸν ταῦρον, and cf. Diod. 4. 59,
where Aegeus receives and sacrifices the bull. But in Apollod.
epit. 1. 5 Medea warns Aegeus to beware of Theseus, who is
accordingly sent against the bull; on the victorious return of
Theseus, the attempted poisoning and the recognition follow.
Ov. Met. 7. 434 gives the same order of events. Thus, Apollo
dorus confirms the statement of Myth. Vat. 1. 48 that Theseus
was sent against the bull at the direct instigation of Medea, and
we may conjecture that Sophocles adopted this version. The
disappearance of Medea’s agency in other accounts in attributed
by Gruppe (p. 580 2) to the influence of Euripides, who did not
include the Marathonian adventure 1. The considerations which
have been mentioned justify us in restoring fr. 24 to the Aegeus,
from which Nauck in his second edition separated it; and it is
probable that fr. 905 also belongs here.</p>

<p>From these facts it has rightly been
inferred that the lemma of Hesych. represents
the text of Sophocles, but πῶμα
(Νauck) should be restored in place of
the later substitute πόμα: see Cobet,
N. L. p. 455, V. L. p. 85. M. Schmidt
preferred στόμα. It should be added that
Athenaeus shortly before (122 A), after
quoting Ar. Eq. 83 f., adds οὐ γὰρ ἂν
εἴποιμι Ταύρειον ὕδωρ πιεῖν, ὅπερ σὺ οὐκ
οἶσθα τί ἐστιν. Brunck strangely inferred
that Athen. and Hesych. were really
quoting fr. 178, which he accordingly
supposed to have belonged to the Aegeus,
substituting πῶμα Ταύρειον for αἶμα ταύρειον.
Pausanias (2. 32. 7) mentions that the
<note type="footnote">1 R. Wagner’s  theory (Epit. Vat. p. 125) that Euripides was the first to connect it with Medea is altogether improbable.</note>

source of the river Hyllicus, which was
originally known by the name Taurius,
was to be found on the mountain path
leading. to Hermione, and that in the
same neighbourhood was the rock called
after Theseus, because he found beneath
it the sandals and sword of Aegeus. This
is enough to show that an allusion to the
river Taurus is appropriate to the subject
of Sophocles’ play, For the situation of
the Syllicus see Frazer’s Pausanias, III

σθῦρα. Hartung interpreted these words
as referring to Periphetes, called also
Corynetes, whom Theseus overthrew in
daurus. This view might be supported
from Apollod. 3. 217, where his weapon
is described as κορύνην σιδηρᾶν; but two
of the recently discovered authorities
establish beyond dount that the allusion
is to Procrustes (or Procoptes), who fitted
his victims to the bed provided for them
either by cutting off the extremities of
those who were too big, or by hammering
out the bodies of those who were too
small. The duplicated name corresponds
to the double function. His weapon,at
any rate for the beating-out process, was
a hammer: see Bacchyl. 17. 27 Πολυπήμονότ

<p>2 The reading is very uncertain (see

and Casaubon’s  παίων has a high degree
of probability. On the other hand, ἠλόησε
(-ῆσαι codd.) is too good to be due to
accident, and the metre may be restored
by an alteration in the order of the words,
and the introduction of the Homeric
compound ἀπηλο(ι)ησιεν, which is used (Δ
522) of the crushing of a man’s  leg by
a rock huried at him. Mekler’s  cojassumes
that the lines are trochaic with
—&#x23D1;– missing at the beginning of the first;

to be certain that ἄλλο μηδέν and καρα are
both accountives, so that the subject is to
be looked for in v. 3. At any rate, the
order of the words shows that τούκείνης
κὰρα bears the main emphasis, and is
co-ordinated and contrasted with ἄλλο
μηδέν : see n. on fr. 940 εἰ σῶμα δοῦλον,
ἀλλ’ ὁ νοῦς ἐλεύθερος, and Headlam on
Aesch. Ag. 357 ff. (2) With κἄν must
be supplied ικνήσῃ or whatever may be
the verb in v. 3: cf. Ar. Ach. 1021 μέτρησον
εἰρήντης τί κἂν πέντ’ ἔτη.
(3) The words ἐν φύλλοισιν have a
certain awkwardness; and clearly they
do not qualify the clause κἂν ἄλλο μηδέν.
Thus the general sense would be ‘even
if the breeze is so light as to stir nothing
else, it aways the poplar’s head amidst its
foliage,’—in summer as well as in winter.
But it is difficult to see hos ἐν φύλλοισιν
can is interpreted leafage (L. and S.).


<pb n="19"/>
Hence conjectures like F. W. Schmidt’s
ὡςἐν θυέλλαισιν γὰρ, and several of Blaydes.
(4) That κάρα is the object of ἀνακουφίζει
is suggested, if not required, by O.T. 23
(πόλις) σαλεύει κάνακουφίσαι κάρα| βυθῶν
ἔτ’ οὐχ οἴα τε φοινίου σάλου. Thus the
lines express more than the schol. states,
the quivering of poplar leaves in the breeze
(Ov. Am. 1. 7. 54 ut cum populeas ventilat
aura comas, Her. 14. 40); but their
truth to nature, as interpreted above, is
within everyone’s  observation. Dindorf’s
elegant conjecture κινεῖ τις αὔρα (with
κἀνακουθίζει, which seems inevitable) is
accepted by Nauck, but it does not get
over the difficulty of πτερόν. The same
remark applies to Tucker’s ingenious supplement
to Dindorf’s correction, τοὐν κείνης
κάρᾳ for τοὐκάνης κάρα. Blaydes, making
κάρα subject, proposed κινηθὲν αὔραις ὠς
πτερὸν κουφίζεται (or τὴν κόμην ἀναπτεροἲ),
as well as several other alternatives. Herwerden
reads κλίνει τις αύρα κάνακουθίζει
πεsόν, where κλίνει, although otherwise
attractive, is less suited than κινεῖ to supply
a verb to κἂν ἄλλο μηδίν. See also Babr.
36. 12 κἂν βαιὸν ἡμῶν ἄνεμοτ ἄκρα κινήσῃ.
F. W. Schmidt altered πτερόν to ῥέπον,
Gomperz to πάλιν. But I do not think
that πτερόν is likely to be corrupt, and
prefer to suppose that it refers to the
‘wings of to the wind‘ (see Psalms 18. 10,
104. 3), reading κινῆσαν αὔρας, and making
αὔρας πτερόν the subject to ἀνακουφίζει,
which is merely emphasized by καί (Trach.
490, Phil. 380). The metaphor is none
too bold for Sophocles; wind-gods such as
Boreas were regularly represented in fifth
century art as winged. In Latin literature
there are many parallels: cf. e.g. Ov.
Met. 1. 264 madidis Notus evolat alis, and
see Thesautus i 1465, 50. It is possible
that this was M. Schmidt’s view, who in
Philol. XVIII 229 f. proposed to read
πτερῷ for πτερόν, but he gives no explanation
of his conjecture. Wecklein’s 
κινῇ τις αὔρα, πάντα κουφίζει πτερόν
(i.e. ‘omnia tolluntur’) is condemned
by the awkwardness of πτιρόν. Η., who
thought that the subj. κινήσῃς was due
to κἄν in the previous line, suggested
κίνησις αἴρει; but we cannot do without
αὔρα.</p>

<p>This fragment was fortmerly assigned to
the Aegeus with general consent; but
Nauck, who in his ist edition followed
thecommon opinion, subsequently changed
his mind, and without giving any reason
spoke of the ascription as ‘improbable.’
I cannot see to what play the words are
appropriate, if not to the Aegeus, especially
now that our data have been enlarged
in regard to the scope of the play: see
Introductory Note. The reference to
Pallas points in the same direction, as
may be seen from Plut. Thes. 13.</p>
<p>There is not very much direct evidence,
apart from this passage of Strabo, touching
the fourfold division of Attica between
the sons of Pandion. The most explicit
statement to be found elsewhere is in schol.

Πάλλαντι δὲ τὴν παραλίαν, Λύκῳ δὲ τὴν
Διακρίαν, Νίσῳ δὲ τὴν Μεγαρίδα. The
allusion to the Pythion in the Daphne
pass, where a monastery afterwards stood,
indicates that Philochorus is the ultimate
source of the scholiast. Briefer but to’
the same effect, though without the words
μέχρι Πυθίου, is school. Ar. Vesp. 1223.
The school. on Eur. Hipp. 35, who derives
other parts of his note from Philochorus,
has a garbled account, omitting Lycus,
and giving no explanation of the divided
rule. A somewhat different version appears
in Apollod. 3. 206, which agrees
with Pausan. I. 5, 4. 39, 4. According
to this, the four sons divided the country
between themselves after the death of
Pandion, when they had returned to
Athens and expelled the Metionidae:
Apollodorus illustrates Soph. by concluding 
with the words εἶχε δὲ τὸ πᾶν
κράτος Αἰγεύς.</p>
<p>‘ Aegeus speaks: πατὴρ is Pandion.
with the Athenian plains, and the coast
of those plains which was specially called
Ἀκτή (Dict. Geo. I p. 322: cp. Strabo 9
p. 391), the ἄστυ, the πεδιάς, and the ἀκτή.
2. Lycus got the Διακρία, the highland
district in the N.E. of Attica, between
Prnes, Pentelicus and the sea. 3. Nisus
got Megaris, where he founded Nisaea
the sea port. 4. Pallas got τὸ πρὸς
νότον—i.e. the southern coasts, from
Sunium to Cape Brauron on one side
(the E.) and to C. Zoster on the other —
the παραλία.</p>
<p>This legendary division must have had
a basis of fact. After the Megarid had
been reft from Attica, the three other
divisions are found corresponding with
political parties in the sixth century B. C.
—the Πεδειῖς, the Πάραλοι, and the
Διάκριοι (Hdt. I. 59: Plut. Solon 13,
Dict. Geo. II p. 324).’ (J.)</p>
<p>1 ff. These lines cannot be restored
with any certainty, more particularly as
the tradition of Strabo is mutilated: see
cr. nn. (1) Meineke (followed by Nauck)
gave: ἐμοὶ μὲν ὥρισεν πατὴρ | ἀκτὰς ἀπελθεῖν
τῆσδε γῆς... | πρεσβεῖα νείμας· εἶτα...
Λύκῳ. He would fill up the gaps with
προσεσπέρους and δευτέρῳ. (2) Casaubon
conj. and Brunck edited: πατὴρ δ’ ἀπελθεῖν
ὥρισ’ εἰς ἀκτὴν ἐμοί, | πρεσβεῖα νείμας
τῆσδε γῆς· τῷ δ’ αὖ Λύκῳ—but the comb
nation ἐμοὶ μέν ought to be kept.
(3) J. suggests either ἐμοὶ μὲν ἄρχειν (or
ἀρχὴν) ὥρισ’ εἰς ἀκτὰς πατήρ or ἐμοὶ μὲν
ὥρισεν πατὴρ | ἀκτὰς ἀνάσσειν τῆσδε γῆσ
κεκτημένῳ. (4) Blaydes conjectured
τυραννεῖν or ἐνοικεῖν for ἀπελθεῖν and
wisehd to introduce παρακτίας. — Lycus
was subsequently driven out by Aegeus
(Pausan. 1. 19. 3).</p>
<p>4 ἄντίπλευρον, opposite, c. gen. Strabo
speaks of Attica as a triangle with three
πλευραί (or λπευρά); the second which is
μηνοειδής extends as far as Orous in
Boeotia, — τοῦτο δ’ ἐστὶ τὸ δεύτερον πλευρὸν
ἑῷον τῆς Ἀττικῆς (p. 391). — κῆπον, domain,’
as in fr. 956, 3.</p>
<p>5 ὅμαυλος is similarly applied to persons
in a satyr-play of uncertain authorship
(Ox. Pap. 1083, fr. 1. 8): see also Hesych. 
III p. 201 has ὅμαυλον· ὁμόκοιτον, ὁμοῦ
αὐλιζόμενον, and cf. fr. 717, Aesch. Cho.
507 ξυζύγους δ’ ὁμαυλίας. — ἐξαιρεῖ: the act.
is used of the donor, and the middle of the 
recipient. See Jebb on Trach. 245. Hdt.
4. 161 τῷ βασιλέι Βάττῳ τεμένεα ἐξελών.</p>
<p>6 Σκίρωνος ἀκτῆς. The genitive is
governed by ὅμαυλον as = γείτονα. For
the Scironian rocks see on fr. 905. The
route extending for about six miles along
the cliffs between Megara and the Eleusinian
plain, and known in modern times
as the ‘Evil Staircase,’ is described in
Frazer’s Pausaniuas, II p. 546 f. — For the
form Σκίρων (not Σκείρων) cf. Callim. fr.
378. That the form with ι is the older is 
attested by inscriptions on stone (CIG
7723) and vases (Gruppe, p. 5996), — τὸ
πρὸς νότον. Blaydes should not have
jectured νότου, for the accusative is well
established: see Kuehner-Gerth 1 515.</p>
<p>7 f. The fifty sons fo Pallas had


<pb n="21"/>
already plotted against Aegeus before
the appearance of Theseus, wishing to
secure for themselves the succession to 
the throne (Plut. Thes. 3). Subsequently,
Pallas and his sons revolted against
Theseus (Pausan. 1. 22. 2), but were
destroyed by him (Apollod. epit. 1. 11,
Plut. Thes. 13. Pausan. 1. 28. 10, Eur.
Hipp. 35). — The description of Pallas’s
sons as ginats is very remarkable, and
the reason is not plain. We may note,
howerver, the following coincidences which
link the legend of the battle between the 
giants and the gods with the defeat of the
Pallantidae (Gruppem, Gr. Myth. p. 438).
(1)	Athena was called Pallas because she
slew a giant of that name: Suid. s. v.
Πάλλας, Etynt. M. p. 649, 54; cf. Apollod.
1.37. (2) As the Chalcidic Pallene was
the scene of the ginats’ defeat, so Tehseus
destroyed the Pallantidae at the Attic
Pallene (Plut. l. c.). (3) Two of Pallas’s
sons were named Clytus and Butes (Ov.
Met. 7. 500), two of the giants Clytius and
Botes. It is further to be observed that
Tzetzes theog. Matranga 11 580 calls
Aegeus and Hippolytus giants. It may
be, however, that the Pallantidae are
called γίγαντες in virtue of their insolent
opposition to authority; in the case of
Capaneus (Aesch. Theb. 411, quoted by
J.) the significance of the name is obvious.</p>

<p>The extract clearly relates to the adventure
of the Marathonian bull, and
shows that it formed a part of the plot
of the Aegeus: see Introductory Note.
Theseus did not kill the bull on the spot,
but captured it and drove it back to the
city, where it was subsequently sacrificed
to Athena or Apollo: cf. Plut. Thes. 14
χειρωςάμενος ἐπεδείξατο ζῶντα ὁιὰ τοῦ

the preparation of the cords by which the
bull was led. κλωστῆρσι χειρῶν is
hand-made twistings (of withies). Cf.
Pollux 7. 31 κλωστήρ· οὕτω δὲ καὶ τὴν

Her. 1011 σὺν τῷ γέροντι δεσμὰ σειπαίων

<p>Reitzenstein thinks that the extract is
made from a somewhat lengthy discussion
of ὀργάζω. and assigns it to Phrynichus
on the strength of Bekk. andced. p. 7, 3
and p. 53, 31.</p>
<p>ΑΙΓΙΣΘΟΣ</p>
<p>The evidence connecting Sophocles with a play bearing this
title is so doubtful that it is idle to speculate as to its contents.
Livius Andronicus wrote an Aegithus, which apparently was
based on the Homeric version of Agamemnon's murder; and
Accius an Aegisthus as well as a Clytaemestra: Ribbeck, TRF2
pp.1,161. See also Introductory Note to the Iphigenia.</p>

<p>Such is the restoration of Gomperz as
given in his edition; and it is evident that
the latter part of the extract is very doubtful,
and that both the name of Sophocles
and what he said rest upon an uncertain
conjecture. Wilamowitz IAnal. Eur. p.
161) also reads 161) also reads C;Σοφοκ&#x003E; [λ] ῆς δ’ ἐν Μυσοῖς
above. This is the more vexing, as there
is no extant passage so clearly marked as
the fragment of Aeschylus (fr. 70), or
Eur. fr. 877 ἀλλ’ αἰθὴρ τίκτει σε, κόρα, |
Ζεὺς ὅς ἀνθρώποις ὀνομάζεται, fr. 941 ὁρᾷς
τὸν ὑψοῦ τόνδ’ ἄπειρον αἰθέρα | . . . τοῦτον
νόμιζε Ζῆνα, τόνδ’ ἡγοῦ θεόν: cf. frs. 839,
911. The lines of Aeschylus are preserved
by Clement of Alexandria: Ζεύς
ἐστιν αἰθήρ, Ζεὺς δὲ γῆ, Ζεὺς δ’ οὐρανός, |
Ζεύς τοι τὰ πάντα χὤτι τῶνδ’ ὑπέρτερον;
and the evidence of Philodemus has
effectually silenced the doubts of those
who thought that Clement was handing
down a false tradition. it has now been
showen that the pantheism of Aeschylus is
due to Orphic influences, and that such a
doctrine flourished in Orphic circles in
the sixth century or even earlier: see
Gomperz, Greek Thinkers, 1 p. 97 E. tr.
Perhaps then the hinted identification of
ἡλιωπὸς οὐρανός and ἡλιωπὸς Ζεύς is less
remarkable in Sophocles than it appears
at first sight.</p>
<p>For the connexion of Helios with Zeus
see on fr. 752. — ἡλιωπός does not occur
elsewhere, but belongs to a class of adetc.)
which is common in tragedy. In
many cases the second member of the
compound had so weakened that it
became a mere suffix, as has been shown
by Sturtevant in Class. Phil. VII 428 ff.
In ἡλιωπός, however, the meaning ‘appearance’
can still be recognized (ibid.
p. 422).</p>

<p>ἄρρυθμος may be either without rhythm
as in Arist. rhel. 3. 8. 1408b 24, where it
is contrasted with ἔμμετρος having the
rhythm of verse, and is said to be unlimited 
(ἀπέραντον); οr else having bad
rhrthm, discordant, as when it is con
trasted with τὸ εὔρυθμον (Plat. rep. 400 V.

Sophocles, and so metaphorically or
Eur. Hipp. 529 μήτ’ ἄρρυθμος ἔλθοις (??)ξ

<p>ΑΙΘΙΟΠΕΣ</p>
<p>Heyne conjectured that this title should be identified with
the Memnon which is mentioned with other Trojan plays in the
Argument to the Ajax (p. 3 J.). He is followed by Welcker
(p. 136), and is probably right, although anything in the nature
of proof is of course impossible. The outline of the plot may


<pb n="23"/>
in that case be gathered from Proclus chrestom. (Αἰθιοπίς, EGF
p. 33) Μέμνων δὲ ὁ  Ἠοῦς υἱὸς ἔχων ἡφαιστότευκτον πανοπλίαν
παραγίνεται τοῖς Τρωςὶ βοηθήσων· καὶ Θέτις τῷ παιδκὶ τὰ κατὰ

τούτῳ μὲν Ἠὼς παρὰ Διὸς αἰτησαμένη ἀθαναςίαν δίδωσι.
Aeschylus also wrote a play entitled Memnon (TGF p. 41), and
made the death of Memnon the subject of his Ψυχοσταςία.</p>
<p>Wagner thought that Strabo 728 made a slip in quoting
Aeschylus (fr. 405) as his authority for the statement that
Memnon’s mother was a Cissian woman, and that it ought to 
have been attributed to Sophocles.</p>

Cf. O. T. 1152 σὺ πρὸς χάριν μὲν οὐκ

ἐκών, οὐ βίᾳ the purpose is not merely
rhetorical, but to anticipate an objection,
as μἤ τοὕτο λίξῃς shows. Herwerden
(Eur. Hel. p. 101) thought that Sophocles
must have written πρὸς χάριν τε κού
βίαν as ‘longe concinnius.’ This is an
odd judgment: for such variations are of
the essence of Greek style.</p>

The same words are found in Etym. Μ.

explanation οὐ κεχυμένοι τῇ σαρκώσει,
ἀλλὰ συνεσφιγμένοι. Hence Naber, in his
edition of Photius, proposed to restore
Σοφοκλῆς Αἰθίοψι &#x003C;σφηκοὺς καλεῖ&#x003E; τοὺς
ἐσφιγμένους μύρμηκας &#x003C;καὶοὐ κεχυμένους&#x003E;

that the words formed part of an allusion
to the giant Indian ’ants’ described by
Herodotus 3. 102 — 105, as being smaller
than dogs but larger than foxes, resembling
the Greek ant in form, and pursuing with
exceeding swiftness the Indians who come
to gather the gold-bearing sand. These
animals, he thinks, were mentioned in a
description of Mesopotamia, the home of
Memnon, to which belonged the epithet
ὀρθόπτερος (fr. 33). Nauck, who accepts
᾿sf view, would prefer to alter καὶ ὁ
σφήν in Photius to λαλεῖ σφηκούς. Lobeck
(Pkryn. p. 674) took an entirely different
view of the meaning; and found a clue to
it in the fact that a cestus with metal studs
was called μύρμηξ. R. Holland in Koscher
II 2656 sees in μύρμηκες an allusion to the
Myrmidons.</p>
<p>In the absence of the context it is best
to connect ἐν δεσμώμασιν with σφηκοί,
’pinched with strapping’: cf.

σφηκός appears to be an adjective with
the sense of σφηκώδης: Ar. Plut. 561
ἰσχνοὶ καὶ σφηκώδεις καὶ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς
ἀνιαροί is well illustrated by Heliod. 10.

is parodied in Ar. Ach. 1082

which refers to a locust.</p>

that the word must mean flower-fed, unless
it can be shown that βόσκειν ἄνθη was
applied to a gardener. But, as an epithet
of the bee, the compound agrees with the
normal usage of βόσΚω, for which see
Neil on Ar. Eq. 255, inf. fr. 140. It is
perhaps superfluous to quote Horn. B 89

καὶ τὰ περίστῳα. Hesych. 111 p. 219
explains the word but does not refer to
Sophocles as using it: ὀρθότερος· μεγάλους
κολωνοὺς (μεγαλώ. ους cod.) ἔχουσα·
πτερὰ γὰρ τὰ εἰς ὔψος ἀνέχοντα. ἥ μεγάλας

Blaydes) οἰκοδομάς.</p>
<p>The corrupt text of Hesych. was formerly
restored as μεγάλους ὥμους ἔχουσα, and
Ellendt mentions without approving it a
proposal to substitute ὥμους for κολωνούς
in Phot., thus giving to the adjective a
meaning similar to that of εὐρύστερνος.
But there can be little doubt that ὀρθόπτερος
was used by Sopb.in reference to a
place or building, (1) In the latter case
the meaning is easy: ὀ. would be like
περίπτερος an epithet of ναός, signitying
flanked with columns. The word περίπτερος
occurs several times in Atben.

describing custyli ratio, πτερόν is properly
applied to the projection of the ceiling of

cella on either side and rests upon the

name ἀετός, as given to the gable: Guhl
and Koner, p. 21. Cf. Ant. 285 ἀμφικίονας
ναούς, with Jebb᾿s n. (2) But the lexicographers
appear to assert that Sophocles
gave to ὀρθοπτερον the meaning. ‘with
lofty hills.᾿ It is impossible to say what
justification, if any, they had for making
this statement.</p>
<p>ΑΙΧΜΑΛΩΤΙΔΕΣ</p>
<p>Welcker᾿s treatment of this play (pp. 171—176) is fanciful
and unconvincing From fr. as compared with Eur. Tro. 1136
he concludes that the death of Astyanax was the central incident
of the actioin. Next he infers that the Astyanax of Accius
(Ribbeck, Röm. Trag. 412 ff.) was copied from Sophocles, because
the remaining fragments do not sow any point of contact with
the Troades and no other model suggests itself. Accius also
wrote a Troades, which Welcker thinks was copied from
Aeschylus. All this is uncertain in the extreme, and, even if our
play was one of Accius’ sources, we know too little of his methods
to be justified—in the absence of any corroboration—in using
the fragments of the Astyanax for the reconstruction of the

<pb n="26"/>
Αἰχμαλωτίδες. The title obviously suggests that the plot was
similar to that of the Troades; but the fragments are unfortunately
indecisive, and the only certain fact is the statement in
the Argument to the Ajax that the play belonged to the Τρωικὴ
πραγματεία. There is nothing whatever to support Ahrens's
guess that the plot is to be found in Hygin. fab. 109, which
deals chiefly with the story of Iliona.</p>
<p>On the other hand, A. Schoell and Bergk1 conjectured that the
play was largely concerned with the demand for the restitution
of Chryseis as related in the first book of the Iliad. This view
was mainly based on frs. 40 and 43; but Hartung, who accepted
it, unwarrantably assumed that Chryses was an alternative title
for the same play on the ground that frs. 38 and 730 should be
identified.</p>
<p>Brunck strangely thought that the Αἰχμαλωτίδες was a satyrplay.
The reason which moved him is no longer applicable,
since it is now admitted that the line which Harpocration appears
to attribute to Sophocles (fr. 34) is actually a fragment from a
comic poet.</p>
<p>More recently Ο. Rizzo2 endeavoured to reconstruct the play,
with the help of a sepulchral relief discovered near the Porta
Salaria at Rome, and of the fragments of Accius. He concludes
that Odysseus was the chief character on the Greek side, and
that he announced to Andromache the impending execution
of Astyanax. The latter was not a child, as in Euripides, but a
full-grown youth.</p>

μεγάλων συμφορῶν.᾿ The second extract
in Harpocration was printed by the earlier
editors as a fragment of Sophocles, but
Nauck is almost certainly right in attributing
it to a comic poet. The lexicographer's
note is attached to Dem. 18.
259 (part of the famous description of
Aeschines) καθαίρων τοὺς τελουμένους
Καὶ ἀπομάττων τῷ πηλῷ καὶ τοῖς πιτύροις.
περιμάττειν and ἀπομάττειν are
both technical terms in connexion with
ceremonies of lustration and purification.
The former, according to the explanation
of Wvttenbach (on Plut. de supersl. 3
Ρ. 166 A), denotes the smearing of the body
with the magic substance, and the Litter
the wiping off, ’sed utrumque promiscue
de tota lustratione ’ Hence both
words are sometimes coupled with καθαίρειν:

sary to follow Campbell in making it
equivalent to ’acts or means of purification.’

The description would fit
as Epimenides.</p>
<p>Hartung, following Schoell's view
the subject of the play is the same as that
of the 1st book of the Iliad, thinks that this
line is part of an appeal for a prophet who
shall be competent to save the army from
the plague. Weleker holds that the
reference is to Calchas.</p>

from the melting-pot or crucible itself:
χῶνος τρήματα ἴχων συνεχῆ τέσσαρα (leg.

Both meanings appear in the glosses preserved
in Eustath. od. ρ. 1926, 52
Dion. fr. 249 Schw.), the last of which
agrees with Photius: ἴσως δὲ ἐκ τοιούτου

κάλαμον. ἐμφαίνει δὲ τοιοῦτόν τι καὶ ὁ
κωμικὸς ἐν Βατράχοις, ὑπολύριον εἰπὼν
δόνακα. There can be very little doubt
that the note with the quotations goes
back to the best days of Alexandrian
scholarship, and it would also appear
that at that time the mention of δόναξ
(or κάλαμος) in connexion with the lyre
was an obscure matter. The explanation
they adopted wis that the bridge over
which the strings are stretched so as to
keep them from adhering to the soundingboard
was a reed instead of being made
of horn, as in later days. (This is entirely
distinct from the common use of Κέρατα
= πήχεις for which see on fr. 244.) In
other words, κάλαμος was to be understood
as the equivalent of μαγάδιον (Lucian
dial. deor. 7. 4 καὶ μαγάδιον ὑποθείς), and
the same interpretation was adopted for Ar.
Ran. 233 προσεπιτέρπεται δ ὁ φορμικτὰς
᾿Απόλλων | ἔνεκα δόνακας, ὃν ὑπολύριον
ἔνυδρον ἐν λίμναις τρέφω. We are not in
a position to say whether the Alexandrian
view is correct; but it is not altogether
satisfactory, inasmuch as it fails to take
account of the description of the primitive
lyre given in the Homeric hymn to
Hermes (4. 47 ff.), in which there is no
mention of a bridge and δόνακες καλάμοιο
occupy an entirely different position, viz.
as fixed in the shell to form a framework
over which oxhide was stretched so as to
produce a sounding-board. (Allen and
’s reference to the passage of Pollux
is based on a wrong assumption that icipara
in his text = πήχεις.) And, in spite of the
traditional opinion to the contrary, such
may have been the meaning of κάλαμος
both in Soph, and in Aristoph. In either
case, whether κάλαμος is the bridge or part
of the sounding-board, the meaning of
our line is clear: ’you are like a lyre
which has lost its ’ Campbell, who
reads σοι, renders: ’a reed, as it were,
has been abstracted from your ᾿ and
thinks that it is appropriate to a chieftain,
perhaps Agamemnon, who has had his
γέρας taken away. Rut it seems more
likely that the subject to ὑφῃρέθη οccurred
in the previous line, and I have accordingly
placed a comma after σου. The comparison
is with that which, seemingly intact, is
yet so maimed as to be deprived of all its
virtue. Thus of Cassandra, after the loss
of her honour, it might have been said:
&#x003C;καὶ τὸ θεσπίζειν σαφῆ&#x003E;
Herwerden, reading σοι, thought
that the words referred to a man ’morbo
aut senectute aut vitae denique calamitatibus

σκορπίον, ὦ ἑταῖρε, φυλάσσεο. It is
amplified in the scolion (23 B.4) quoted by
A then. 695 D ὑπὸ παντὶ λίθῳ σκορπίος, ὦ
ἐταῖρ᾿ ὑποδύεται. | φράζεο μή σε βάλῃ· τῷ

nat. an. 15. 26 εἰ γὰρ τοῦτο μὴ γένοιτο (i.e.
if the road for the Great King's journey
not thoroughly examined beforehand), ὁ
χῶρος ἄβατός ἐστιν· ὑπὸ παντὶ γὰρ λίθῳ
καὶ βώλῳ πάσῃ σκορπίος ἐστί. The lexicographers
and paroemiographers apply
it ἐπὶ τῶν κακοήθων: see Phot., Hesych.,
Suid., Zenob. 6. 20, Diogen. 8. 59.
Nauck thinks that in Zenobius the words
ταύτης μέμνηται Σοφοκλῆς which are attached
to the previous proverb (see on fr.
814) should be transposed to follow this.
For the similar saying ἔνα λίθον ἄρας πένθ᾿

The usage of both words fluctuates:
ἐσχάρα is generally the more specific,
meaning (1) a sacrihcial hearth level with
the ground, (2) a movable brazier, (3) a
hollow on the upper surface of the altar;
but just as βωμός is sometimes employed
in the two former of these senses so ἐσχάρα
takes the place of βωμός freguently
in verse (cf. fr. 730) and occasionally in
prose and inscriptions. Here of
the explanation of Stephanus h.
reference to the text of Sophocles, for εσχάρας
appears to be a possessive geni ivc,
and βωμιαῖον relates to the structure: ’the
raised (pedestal) of the altar.’
in Eur. Phoen. 274 (n.) βώμιοι ἐσχάραι
’the structured ᾿ ; but in Andr.
1138 βωμοῦ κενώσας δεξίμηλον ἐσκάραν
the meaning is rather ’the sacrificial slab
of the altar (mound),’ for it is
say whether the form or the chara
βωμός is the more prominent, for further
information see Reisch in Pauly- Wissowa

n in the neighbourhood of the gulf
of Adramyttium is described by Strabo
612; he also states that the older town of
Chrysa was destroyed, and that the new
town, to which the temple of Apollo was
transferred, was near Hamaxitus on the
slope of Mt Lekton. It should be observed
that Stephanus has confused this
Chrysa (or Chryse) with the small island
of the same name in the neighbourhood of
Lemnos, for which see on fr. 384.
Meineke, who observes that the codd.
of Stephanus indicate a lacuna after
Χρὐσην, plausibly suggested that the words
were spoken by Apollo, and that νέμω
should complete the line. It is, however,

<pb n="30"/>
extremely awkward to conruct ταύτην
with the place-names; and I think it is
more likely that Hartung was right in
placing a comma after ἐγώ, and in making
ταύτην refer to one of the captive women.
In the latter case a participle such as
Hartung's ἑλών would follow Χρύσην:
takes the speaker to be Achilles.</p>

<p>The statement of the lexicons that δαῦλον
= μέγα is incredible, even when supported
by the gloss of Hesych. IV p. 234
giving ἁδρόν and μέγα among the explanations
of φαῦλον. But it does not seem
possible to account for the error either by
supposing (1) with Campbell, that the
words are used ironically, or (2) with
Ellendt, that the grammarian who made
the quotation was so stupid as to take
φαῦλα for the antithesis to μικρός. It is
much more likely that the words ἐπὶ τοῦ
μεγάλου are the result οφ a corrupt tradition.
In favour of this conclusion it
should be observed (1) that in Etym. Μ.,
though not in ’hot. and Suid., the catalogue
of meanings and examples is introbuced
by the words φαῦλον σημαίνει δέκα;
(2) that the tenfold division is recognized
in the abbreviated list without examples
given in Bekk. anecd. p. 315, 1 τὸ φαῦλον
σημαίνει δέκα, ἐπί τε προσώπου Καὶ πράγματος
τὸ κακόν, τὸ μικρὸν καὶ τὸ εὐκαταφρόνητον,
καὶ τὸ ἀσθενές, καὶ τὸ ἄδοξον,
καὶ τὸ ἀνόητον, καὶ τὸ ἁπλοῦν, καὶ τὸ
ταπεινόν· καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ πένητος, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ
ἐναντίου τῷ σπουδαίῳ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ εὐτελοῦς;
(3) that the last-quoted list, which
contains ten categories but has nothing
corresponding to μέγα, agrees generally
(though not exactly) with the lists of the
three other lexicons, and that all alike go
back to a common original Boethus, the
author of a Platonic lexicon, according to
Naber. From these facts it might be inferred
that the μέγα-ψατεγορυ was not part
of the original note, that the Sophoclean
example was probably cited under the
category named τὸ dadcvis in Bekk. anecd.,
and that the words ἐπὶ τοῦ μεγάλου are a
corruption of ἐπὶ τοῦ ἐναντίου τῷ μεγάλῳ
or something of the same kind. But, if it
seems incredible that the line of Sophocles
was ever seriously quoted to prove that
δαῦλον was a synonym of μέγα, some
other explanation must be sought for the
persistence of the category μέγα in Eustath.

φαῦλον στόμα as an ygly mouth;
but perhaps φαῦλον was interpreted powerful
as being injurious: cf. Eur. Phoen.
94, Andre. 870.</p>
<p>Ellendt well suggests that the words
quoted may have been preceded by μὴ
Θαυμάζετε, ’don’t be surprised that I who
am naught have won a paltry victory.’
They are a particular application of pro-
verbial wisdom: cf. Pind. Pyth. 3. 107

ἔσσομαι. So in another connexion τὴν
κατὰ σαυτὸν ἔλα — τὰ φαῦλα is an internal
ace. rather than the direct object: cf. Eur.

A 14 f. Headlam (J. P. XXX 316), followed

(Athen. 455 F) τροφαλίδας τε λινοσάρκους·
μανθάνεις; τυρὸν λέγω and other passages,
but the evidence is too weak to count
against the numerous instances to the
contrary. However this may be, it is improbable
that Campbell was right in
eliminating the reference to some kind of
shoe: Hesych. II p. 540 has κρούπανα·
ξύλινα ὐποδήματα, but κρούπεζαι is the
better-supported term (Cratin. fr. 310 ι
103 K. οὗτοι δ᾿ εἰσὶν συοβοιωτοί, κρουπεζοφόρον
γένος ἀνδρῶν). If this be so, it is
worth considering the suggestion of M.
Mayer that the line refeis to Priam, making
an attempt to escape from the Greeks.
But ὑπεκδύς will not account for χρυσδύς,
and I cannot help thinking that the corrupt
word conceals an allusion to the elaborately
fashioned shoes of the oriental
monarch with their decoration of gold.
So χρυσεοσάνδαλον ἔχνος of Helen and
of the Muses in Eur. Or. 1468, Ι. Α. 1042.
Pollux 7. 86, 92 mentions advbaXa Τυρρηνικά

gold. The metre might be patched with

M. Schmidt holds that the last words

all, but refer to the place called Ἴχναι
in Hdt. 7. 123, of which Steph. Byz.

ἠΧὴν Nauck formerly, ἀΚμήν Blaydes).</p>
<p>The most comprehensive gloss on ἄχνη
is in Etym. M. p. 18 r, 50 ἄχνη πᾶσα
λεπτότης ὑγροῦ τε Καὶ ξηροῦ. Cf. Suid.
s. υ. Καὶ ἄχνη ἁλός, τὸ λεπτότατον τοῦ
ὕδατος, ὁ ἀφρὸς τῆς θαλάσσης. This will
explain its use for teardrops (Track. 849),
for dew Ο. C. 681), for spray from the
sea (Horn. Δ 426), for smoke (Aesch.
fr. 336), and for chaff (Horn. E 499).
The colloquial use in Ar. Vesp. 92 corresponds:
ἢν δ’ οὖν καταμύσῃ κἂν ἄχνην—
’even a wink.’ Here the reference is
the delicacy or glossiness of the material:
’the fine-spun product of the Lydian
shuttle.’ There is no reason to find
with Hesychius’ explanation, but the
that this use of ἄχνη arises by
direct transference from the meaning
spray is unnecessary. ἄκρως is a common
word in the scholia to Sophocles: see
schol. Ο. Τ. ι18, Ο. C. 1695. Hippocrates
used ἄχνη for fluff or shreds
of linen, the substance of lint: Erotian
p. 50, 1 2 ἄχνη ὀθονίου· τὸ παρ᾿ ἡμῖν λεγόμενον
ξύσμα, ἐξ οὐ γίγνεται μοτός. So

<p>Richness and luxuriousness of dress are
often attributed to the Lydians, whose
fashions were copied by the Ionians of

ornament as well as Lydian harmony,

<p>Sarpedon is both a personal and a

from his famous namesake, the son of
Zeus, was the eponymous hero of the
Thracian promontory (schol. Eur. ’hts.
19). He was slain by Heracles on his
return from Troy (Apollod. 2. 105). The
occurrence of the name in these parts has
been connected with other evidence of
the settlement of Cretans on the N. coasts
of the Aegean (Gruppe, Gr. Myth. Ρ. 209).
Our authorities also mention a rocky

to a rope used for any other purpose,
although at first sight such an inference

<p>There is no other trace of the existence
of ἐμπλευροῦν. The meaning would seem
to be ’dash against his ᾿ ’charge him,’

Hlaydes proposes ἐμπλευροῦ, in
place of ἐμπλεύρου. At first sight this is
plausible, but it appears that ἐμπλευροῦν
follows the analogy of γναθοῦν (Befck.

curious broken Greek of the Persian is
quoted. The prevalence of the archaic
form indicates an attempt to represent
the Persian pronunciation: ’in Persian
all Greeks were called Yauna’
on Ach. 1. c). The effeminacy of the
Asiatic Ionians prejudiced their kinsmen
in Greece against the name: Hdt. 1

it is stated that Sophocles used Ἴαννα
(1) as an adj.= Ἑλληνική in the Αἰχμαλωτίδες,
(2) as a description of a Greek
woman, or specifically of Helen, in the
Triptolemus and Ποιμένες. In place of
Ἴαννας it seems almost certain that we
ought to read ’Iapas with L. Dindorf,
Lobeck, and others (’Iάονας

<p>For ἴσισυς Heringa restored ἱερεύς, and
nothing better has been suggested. For
γεροιδάν J. Pearson conjectured γεροίταν,
altering ἱερόλας to ἱεροίτας accordingly,
and this view, so far as concerns γεροίταν,
was approved by Lobeck (Path.
prol. p. 387). On the other hand, Dindorf
proposed γηρόλαν to correspond with
the lemma, ἢ γεροῦντος baffles the critics
altogether, and is rejected by M. Schmidt
as a marginal gloss. Heringa's ἢ
has no probability. It should be
added that a few lines before the MS of
Hesychius gives ἰερόμας τῶν ἱερῶν ἐπιμελούμενος.
Musurus restored ἱεροκόμος, but
M. Schmidt combines it with the present
glossthus: ἱερόλας· τῶν ἱερῶν ἐπιμελούμενος.
῾ἱερόλας ἴσισυς᾿ Σοφοκλῆς Αἰχμαλωτίσι, ὃς
καὶ τὸν γηρῶντα γηρόλαν λέγει. But what
is ἴσισυς? ἱερόλας may be right, but it
belongs to a class of words more appropriate
to comedy than tragedy, and, if
used by Sophocles, was probably contemptuous.
The best-known of its cognates
are μαινόλης (Sappho), and σκωπτόλης
(Ar. Vesp. 788); some are mere vulgarisms,
such as ὀζόλης, οἰφόλης, σιφόλης, κορυπτόλης,
ὀπυιόλης; κοιόλης, said to mean a
priest, is obscure. Lobeck (phrynichus,
p. 613; path. Prol. p. Ι29) adds the proper
names Μισγόλας, Ἀργόλας, φειδόλας,
Πυθόλης. The formation, though not
primitive (Brugmann, Comp. Gr. II p.
211), is not compounded from ὄλλυμι.</p>

Considerable notoriety was acquired at
Athens during the time of the Peloponnesian
war by a ventriloquist named
Eurycles, who professed the power of
divination by means of a familiar spirit.
Hence Aristophanes producing his plays
through others compares himself to Eurycles:
Vesp. 1019 μιμησάμενος τὴν Εὐρυκλέους
μαντείαν καὶ διάνοιαν, | ὤστ᾿ ἀλλοτρίας
γαστέρας ἐνδὺς κωμῳδικὰ πολλὰ
χέασθαι. Plat. Soph. 252 C says that the
opponents of predication are convicted
out of thier own mouths: ἐντὸς ὑπονφθεγγόμενον
ὤσπερ τὸν ἄτοπον Εύρθκλέα
περιθέροντες ἀεὶ πορεύονται. Cf. Plut.
dcf. or. 9 p. 414 E  ευηθες γάρ ἐστι καὶ
παιδικὸν κομιδῇ τὸ οἴεσθαι τὸν θεὸν αὐτὸν
ὤσπερ τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους, Εὐρυκλέας
πάλαι νυνὶ δὲ Πύθωνας προσαγορεουμένους.
ἐνδυὀμενον εἰς τὰ σώματα τῶν προφητῶν
ὐποφθέγγεσθα, τοῖς ἐκείνων στόμασι καὶ
φωναῖς χρώμενον ὀργάνοις. Aristid. I 30
Dind., speaking of the inspiration of
Dionysus, ἀκριβέστερον Εὐρθκλέους τᾶνδοθεν
καταλαμβάνων, indicates, in the
same way as Plutarch, that Eyrycles
was a generic name given to spirits
temporarily occupying the body of a 
man. There is nothing in these passages
which is not satisfied by the simple inference
that Eurycles alleged his oracles
to be the voice of a demon lodged in
his own breast. so schol., Plat.: Εὐρυκλῆς
γὰρ ἐδόκει δαίμονά τινα ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ ἔχειν,
τὸν ἐγκελευόμενον αὐτῷ περὶ τῶν μελλόντων
λέγειν, and schol. ristoph.: τάληθῆ
μαντευόμενος διὰ τοῦ ἐνυπάρχοντες αὐτῷ
δαίμονοσ. Such a proceeding corresponds
exactly with the methods of  savage magicians,
as reported by E. B. Tylor in
Encycl. Brit.9 VII 63: cheating sorcereres
use ventriloquism of the original kind,
which (as its name implies) is supposed
to be caused by the voice of a demon
inside the body of the speaker, who really
himself talks in a feigned human voice, or
in squeaking or whistling tones thought
suitable to the thin-bodied spirit-visitor.’
It is unnecessary therefore to supposed
that Eurycles was a ventriloquist in any
other sense, or to accept Campbell's in
ference (on Plat. L.c.) that ‘he made his
voice sound as if from within the person
consulting him, For further information
see Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 928.</p>

<p>Jacobs identified this play with the Danae, supposing that it
had an alternative title; and Welcker (p. 349) was inclined to
agree with him, while reserving the possibility that the same
material was used over again by Sophocles for the production of
a satyr-play. It should be added that Meineke (on Ο. C. ρ. 275)
also held that the Danae was a satyr-play, but there is little
to justify the assumption1. Alternative titles are not common
and should only be accepted where the evidence is quite clear, as
in the case of the Φρύγες or Ἕκτορος λύτρα of Aeschylus (TGF
p. 84). Besides, it is not likely that a play would be named
alternatively after one or other of the principal characters. It
would be more natural to suppose that the citation of the play as
Danae was a mistake, due to the identity of the subject-matter
with that of ’ Danae and the greater celebrity of
the latter. For similar errors see Introduction, § 1. It
however, be admitted that the error, if such it was, was more
persistent than is usually the case, and had infected even the
best critical tradition.</p>
<p>Brunck, on the other hand, considered that the Acrisius must
be identified with the Larissaei, and that its subject was the
accidental killing of Acrisius by Perseus when throwing the
discus. The variation of title would be more natural than in the
other case, but Jacobs appears to be justified in arguing that
frs. 64 and 65, at any rate, are more suitable to the story of
Danae. See also Escher in Pauly-Wissowa IV 2086.</p>
<p>If the identification of the Acrisius with the Danae is correct, it
contained the story up to the time of the discovery of the birth of
Perseus, when Acrisius sent mother and child adrift on the Aegean
in a λάρναξ. Perseus was known to Hesiod as the son of Danae
(Scut. 216), and is mentioned as the son of Zeus and Danae
in Horn. Ξ 319 f. The fullest and best account of the legend
depends on the authority of Pherecydes in schol. Ap. Rhod.
4. 1091, 15 1 5 (FHG I 75). Sophocles refers to the imprisonment
of Danae in the brazen chamber in Ant. 944. There may be
a reference to our play in Menand. Sam. 244 οὐΚ ἀκήκοας

<p>The sentiment, that falsehood is a
sickly growth which soon decays, may be
illustrated by Aesch. Ag. 625 οὐΚ ἔσθ᾿

Ο. T. 614 etc.). Nauck, objecting to
the phrase γῆρας χρόνου in this connexion,
altered γῆρας to μῆκος. This is
an arbitrary proceeding, which destroys a
characteristic subtlety of diction. Τr.:
῾ no falsehood lasts through time's
γῆρας χρόνου follows Aesch. Prom. 1013

Eum. 286 χρόνος καθαιρεῖ πάντα γηράσκων

adesp. 508 μετὰ τὴν σΚιὰν τάχιστα γηράσκει
χρόνος, and Lucian amor. 12 οὐδ᾿
αὐτὰ γέροντος ἤδη χρόνου πολιὰ καθηύαινεν.
It might be thought that γῆρας should be
attributed to ψεῦδος, and that χρόνου could
be spared. But the omission would suggest
the meaning that falsehood is ever
young: cf. Ο. C. 954 θυμοῦ γὰρ οὐδὲν
γῆράς έστιν ἄλλο πλὴν | θανεῖν, Aesch.
Theb. 669 οὐΚ ἔστι γῆρας τοῦδε τοῦ μιάσματος.

<p>The situation supposed, that of a runaway
slave who having been caught says
all he can to win favour, is exactly reproduced
in Eur. Or. 1498 ff. in the case
of Orestes and the Phrygian, who says of
himself δραπέτην γὰρ ἐξέκλεπτον ἐκ
δὁμων πόδα. Orestes taunts him (1514)

a colon after δῆλον γάρ: the asyndeton

δῆλον δέ, σημεῖον δέ, and the like (Kuehner-Gerth,
§ 469, Grottos altered
δῆλον to δοῦλον, and was followed by
Brunck and Diadotf. H. points out that
the order of the words is against taking
δῆλον as a grammatical qualification of
the clause ἐν...λέγει, as if it weress an
adverb or a parenthetical adjunct (scil.
ἐστίν). He quotes Ai. 906 αὐτὸς πρὸς
αὐτοῦ, δῆλον, fr. 585 ἀλγεινό, Πρὁκνη,

<p>(1) The metaphor is generally taken,
as by Ellendt and Campbell, to be that
of a gale which blows for a time and then
subsides. A simile will be required in
English: ῾ most of the terrors that come
in dreams are like a wind that blows by

πνεῖν used metaphorically would connote
a certain degree of vigour or violence as
in Ar. Eq. 437 οὗτος ἤδη καικίας ἢ συκοφαντίας

with μαλάσσεται. Phot. lex. p. 321, 23

φόβος | δόμων ὀνειρόμαντις ἐξ ὕπνου
κότον | πνέων ἀωρόνυκτου ἀμβόαμα,
where the language has several points
of similarity, makes this explanation
doubtful. Kaibel (on El. I.e.) suggests
that the metaphor is taken from the
breath of the voice: a dream is a message
heard. It should be added that μαλάσσεται
is not an apt word in relation to a gale;
its usual application is rather to express
the assuagement of an emotion. Anyhow,
there is no occasion for ᾿s φανέντα
(for πνεύσαντα). — The daylight was believed
to be effective in purging the evil

The scene of the Acrisus was laid at
Argos, and this fact confirms the statement
of Hesychius that shophocles re3ferred
to the Peloponnesian Acte; for this was
also the name given to the cast coast of
Argolis between troezen and Epidaurus.
The alternative is to suppose that he
was alluding to stone imported from
Attica, and that Hesych. is mistaken.

the name of the Cyprian town of Marion,

situated on the N. coast of the island

town of Soli (Strabo 683). The site is
described by Munro and Tubbs in J. H. S.
xi 1 ff. Orus explained the process by
comparing it to πετάλωσις, i.e. the layingon
of gold-leaf. See ᾿s description
of the walls of Atlantis: Criti. 116 B καὶ

The adj. is aptly used of the cattle crowding

driven. Cf. Horn. Θ 215. I have very
little doubt that this was Hesychius’
explanation, and that we ought to read

as οἱ συνεστραμμένοι ἱμάντες. It appears,
then, that L. Dindorf (Thes. II p. 711)
should not have deleted the words καὶ
τὰς συστροφάς. He went on to explain
ἰλλάδες γοναί as referring to plough-oxen,
comparing Ant. 341 ἰλλομένων ἀρότρων.
I presume he took ἰλλάδες as = ῾ turning
to and fro, ’but this is hardly conceivable
without the addition of (e.g.) ἀρότροις.
For the meaning of ἴλλειν ᾿s

be mentioned that M. Schmidt thought
ακρησίῳ in Hesych. was an error for παρὰ
Κρησί. He does not quote Eustathius;
nor would Eustath. throw any light on the
obscurity of Hesych., even if Schmidt's
conjecture were right. It is perhaps
more probable that Soph, used the word
in the former of the two senses recorded
by eustath.; and Hesych.'s ἐλαττούμενον
τοῖς δρόμοις may refer to one who was
too weak to compete in a race. We can
hardly go further, but the alternatives lead
me to suspect that ἀπόδρομος was employed
metaphorically. Hartung quite

<p>The mistaken correction of the title to WXcoaSai was due to
Hemsterhuis on Lucian Charon 3 p. 494, and was supported by
an explanation of fr. 89 from Apollod. I. 55, where Artemis
takes the form of a stag, and by a stratagem induces Otus and
Ephialtes to shoot each other. But ἕκηλος is inconsistent with
this view.</p>
<p>Subsequent investigation has decisively shown that the
subject of the play was the fortunes of Auge and her son
Telephus, and the credit of establishing the truth belongs to
Fr. Vater, who in his dissertation die Aleaden des Sophokles,
Berlin, 1835, first pointed out the significance for the present
purpose of a passage in one of the declamations attributed to
Alcidamas (Odyss. 13 — 16, p. 187 Bl.2). It is there related
how Aleos, king of Tegea, went to Delphi and received an
oracle from the god, warning him that, if his daughter bore a
son, his own sons must die by the hand of his grandson.
Accordingly, on his return home, Aleos made his daughter Auge
priestess of Athena, vowing that he would kill her if she ever
became a wife. It so happened that Heracles came to Tegea,
when on his way to Elis to attack Augeas, and was entertained
by Aleos in the temple of Athena. Heracles saw the girl, met
her in secret, and left her pregnant. When Aleos discovered the
state of affairs, he sent for Nauplius, king of Euboea, and handed
over Auge to him, with directions that she should be drowned1.
However, on the journey from Tegea, Auge gave birth to
Telephus on Mt Parthenius; and Nauplius, disregarding his
instructions, sold mother and child to be conveyed across the sea
to King Teuthras in Mysia. Teuthras, who was childless,
married Auge, and adopted her son, to whom he gave the name
<note type="footnote">1 Cf. the similar story of Aerope, related in the Κρῆσσαι of Euripides: schol. Ai.
1295, Apollod. 3. 15.</note>

<pb n="47"/>
Τelephus. The story was current in several versions, but the
mportance of the account preserved by Alcidamas is that he
alone refers to the oracle given to Aleos, and mentions this
as the reason why Auge was entrusted to Nauplius. Th
once explains the title of ’ play. Confirmation of
Alcidamas is to be found in Proverb. AppttiJ. 2. 87 (Pannm. I
412) as well as in Hygin. fab. 244 Telephus Herculis filius Hippothoum
et Neaerat aviae suaefilios (sc. oeeidit)1. It will be seen that
the name of the other son is lost, and Hippothous is nowhere
else mentioned as a son of Aleos. Apollod. 3. 102 calls the
sons of Aleos and Neaera by the names Cepheus and Lycurgus,
whereas Pausan. 8. 4. 8 and Ap. Rhod. 1. 161 ff. make them
three in number, Lycurgus, Cepheus, and Amphidamas.</p>
<p>As contrasted with the account of Alcidamas, that of
Apollodorus (2. 146) mentions temple-defilement and consequent
λοιμός (or λιμμός, as in 3. 103) as the causes which induced Aleos
to hand over Auge to Nauplius and to expose her child.
Diodorus, however, whose version is more rationalistic, simply
relates (4. 33) that Aleos discovered his daughter to be pregnant,
and sent her away in disgrace, not believing her story that she
with child by Heracles. In regard to the circumstances of the
birth of Telephus, Sophocles and Alcidamas followed different
versions; for the latter allows no place for the suckling of the
infant by a hind, which is clearly referred to in fr. 89. Here,
therefore, the Sophoclean plot approximated to the story as
related in Hiodorus, Apollod. ll. cc., Pausan. 8. 48. 7, 546 2. It
enable to infer that, according to Sophocles, Telephus was
i by the herdsmen of King corythus2, or by corythus
if; and that the question of his birth in some way or other
presented itself to him, when he was grown to manhood.
ding to Apollod. 3. 104 and Diod. l.c. he went to Delphi to
enquire of the oracle, and was sent by the god to Mysia. It will
be observed that the above-mentioned authorities do not give
any information concerning the return of Telephus to the palace
os, or the manner in which he killed his uncles. The gap
can only be filled by conjecture, and there is nothing to help us
t that frs. 86, 8; appear to belong to a scene in which
tion of doubtful birth was canvassed. Wernicke (in Pauly-
Wissowa ΙΙ 2302) inferred that Telcphus was mocked by

Hippothous and his brother for the obscurity of his origin, and
that he slew them in anger; that subsequently Aleos demanded
his surrender from Corythus; that in consequence of the
explanation given he recognized his grandson; and that he then
required him to consult the oracle in order to learn how he should
expiate his blood-guilt. Robert (Arch. Jahrb. 111 61 ff.) thinks it
more likely that the strife between Telephus and the Aleadae
arose out of some incident similar to the Calydonian hunt in the
legend of Meleager. He points out that in that case fr. 84
suitably describes the overthrow of two princes of the royal
house by a foreign bastard. This carries the story to the period
which is covered by the action of the Mysians. Welcker (p. 413)
preferred to suppose that Heracles appeared as deus ex machina
to clear up the dispute, and ordered Telephus to go to Mysia1.</p>
<p>It should be observed that an entirely different version of the
story was adopted by Euripides, to the effect that mother and
child were cast adrift together in a chest by Aleos, but ultimately
reached the mouth of the Caicus, and were rescued by Teuthras
(Strabo 615). Such at least was the account given in the
prologue to the Telephus; for in the later Auge Telephus was
separated from his mother and exposed (Wilamowitz, Anal. Eur.
p. 189 f.). The simpler story, which is parallel to that of Danae,
was given by Hecataeus (Pausan. 8. 4. 8), and is believed,
although the reasons assigned are hardly convincing, to have
been derived from the Cypria and Little Iliad (Wernicke, u.s.
2300). The Pergamene dynasty established by Attalus traced
their descent from Telephus, and the people claimed to be
Arcadians sprung fro the band which crossed with Telephus
to Asia. Thus they were precluded from giving official
recognition to the Xapvag-story, and followed in preference, as
has been shown exhaustively by Robert (Arch. Jahrb. II 244
III 45, 87), the versions of Aeschylus and Sophocles. See also

changed δοῦλον to χρηστὸν, and Nauck
conjectured δειλὸν for δοῦλον. But the
presence of καὶ and αὐτὸν shows that these
corrections are misconceived: the thought
is, ῾It is better to conquer one's foes
even by foul means than to be so reduced
as to be the slave of others.᾿ To a freeborn
Greek slavery is the worst of all
evils; hence the arrogant note in αὐτόν,
which contrasts as in Phil. 316. For the
φύσει δοπυλοι the case is different. It is
not so much slavery that is contrasted
with sovereignty, as degradation with
power once enjoyed. In Eur. Phoen.

<p>4 f. are considered by Ο. Hense to be
an intrusion, and Nauck agrees. — ἔπειτα
δ᾿ , in the next place, distinguishes from
the general advantages bestowed by
wealth the particular fact that no one
seeks to oppose its influence. ‘Not only
does no one become the foe of the rich
man, but even his former enemies dissemble
their hatred.' Meineke's οἴ
ἔχοντες is wide of the mark. — φύεται,
denoting ‘it is no one's nature to ’
(cf. Tr. fr. adesp. 543 οὐΚ ἐν γυναιξί
φύεται πιστὴ χάρις), corresponds to φύντες
— those in whom the condition is realized.

scholiastic word, which Nauck
actually wished to put in the text.
Madvig (Adu. Crit. p. 614) depraved
it still further by proposing χὥποι θέλει·
πένης δ’ ἀνήρ. It will be observed that
the addition of βέβηλα is redundant to the
sense, and serves merely to round off the
expression. The Greek love of antithesis
was sometimes indulged at the expense of
lgic: El. τὰς οὔσας τέ μοι | καὶ τὰς
ἀπούσας ἐλπίδας διέφθορεν, Ant. 1109 ἴτ᾿
ἴτ᾿ ὀπάονες, | οἵ τ’ ὄντες τ’ ἀπόντες. See
also my note on Eur. Hclid. 182 (with
which passage Andoc. 4. 7 should be
compared), and add Alcman fr. 23, 44
ἐμὲ δ’ οὔτ᾿ ἐπαινῆν | οὔτε μωμήσθαι νιν

Creon parades the value of his influence
with Oedipus: νῦν οἱ σέθεν χρῄζοντες
ἐκκαλοῦσί με· | τὸ γὰρ τυχεῖν αὐτοῖσι

Nauck</p>
<p>more likely that οὐδέ would be supplanted
by firfSi than vice versa : see Cobet, var.
Lect. pp. 47, 315.—ἐντυχὼν is used in the
special sense of interviewing, obtaining
an audience: cf. Dem. 19. 175 αὐτὸς δὲ
ἰδίᾳ πάντα τὸν χρόνον ἐντυγχάνων οὑδ᾿
ότιοῦν ἐπαύσατο Φιλίππῳ. This sense
became very common in later Greek:
hence ἔντευξις, ἐντεθυκτικός, δυσέντευκτος,
and even ἐντεθξίδιον (a petition).—The
careless repetition of τυχεῖν after ἐντυχὼν
Eur. Hel. 674 (n.). Meineke's οὐδ᾿ εὐστοχῶν
is unnecessary.—The negative
qualifies both the participle and the
main verb, as in Aesch. Ag. 302 ὅ δ᾿
οὔτι μέλλων οὐδ᾿ ἀφρασμόνως ὔπνῳ | νικώμενος
παρῆκεν ἀγγέλου μέρος: see n. on
Eur. Helid. 813.—The explanation recommended
above is confirmed by the
emphasis which falls more strongly upon
οὐδ᾿ ἐντυχὼν than upon τυχεῖν. J., how
ever, joins τυχεῖν to δεινὸς, interpreting:
῾And knows how to obtain the objects of
its desire in quarters from which the poor
man could not obtain those objects ever.
if they came in his way.᾿ In other words,
῾Walth wins its way to places which are
wholly inaccessible to poverty. But even
in quarters to which poverty may chance
to have access, wealth succeeds where the
other fails.᾿ Tucker proposed μηδ᾿ ἔν γ᾿
ὕπνω quoting Solon ap. Arist. Ath. pol.
12 (p. 48 S.), but the change is unnecessary.
So also is Wecklein's assumption
that after δύναιτ᾿ ἄν something like εὑπίσκιεν
πόρον, | ἐκεῖνος αίἑν οἰδεν is needed.
Hendlam (C. R. xv 99 n.) favoured
εὐτυχῶν, and so Blaydes (see cr. n.).—
For ὧν ἐρᾷ τυχεῖν see on fr. 356.</p>
<p>9 f. καῖ γαρ δυσειδὲς κτὲ. Observe
that καὶ ('enen') qualifies the following
adjectives, although in such cases it is
more usual for γάρ to be postponed (καὶ
δυσειδὲς γάρ). cf. Trach. 92 καὶ γὰρ
ὐστέρῳ τό γ᾿ εῦ | πράσσειν...κέρδος έμπολᾷ,
with Jebb's note. See also Kuchner.</p>
<p>Gerth 11 338.—δθσώνυμον in this context
has given rise to much suspicion:
thus Meineke boldly substituted γῆρα:
νέον for γλώσσῃ σοφόν, coll. Eur. fr. 575;
Wecklein changed γλώσσῃ to γνώμην
with συσειδῆ for δυσειδές; Blaydes read
κἄνδρα δύστομον for καὶ δυσώνυμον; J.
proposed καὶ δύσθρουν στόμα, comparing
Pind. P. 4. 63 δυσθρόου φωνᾶς (῾slow
speech᾿—of Βάττος, the stammerer). But
I am not convinced that δυσώνυμον is unintelligible,
though it cannot mean, as
Brunck suggested, prave loquentem. The
description exactly fits the personality
of Thersites, whom Sophocles may have
had in mind: he too was ῾hated for his
tongue,᾿ cf. Hom. B 222 τῷ δ᾿ ἄρ᾿ Ἀχαιοὶ |
ἐκπάγλως κοτέοντο νεμέσσηθέν τ᾿ ἐνὶ θυμῷ.
On this view, γλώσσῃ schould be connected
with δυσώνυμον, which is an epic word
and is employed in the epic sense: T 571
ἢδε δὴ ὴὼς εἷσι δυσώνυμος ἥ μ᾿ Ὀδυσῆος |
οἴκου ἀποσήσει—῾that accursed day is at
hand...᾿ Note the chiasmus, by which
εὔμορφον relates to δυσειδές, and σοφόν to
δυσώνυμον.</p>
<p>11 f. κὰν νόσων ξυνουσίᾳ. See cr. n.
There are several other conjectures (κού
νοσεῖν Ellendt, ἀφαιρεῖν καὶ νόσων ξυνουσίας
O. Hense, ἀμαυροῦν καὶ νόσων ξυνουσίαν
Holzner, κὰνοσεῖν ἐξονσία Bergk, ὰνοσίων
οτ κάνόμων ἐξουσίᾳ F. W. Schmidt,
ἐᾶν νόσουτ ἐξουσία Enger, καὶ νοσοῦντ᾿
ἐξουσία Parabsileios), but none so satisfactory
as Meineke's, which J. and H.
accepted. H. points out that the Greeks
did not say ἐξουσία πάρεστι but merely
πάρεστι or ἔξεστι, or ἐξουσία (ἐστί): there.
fore ἐξουσία cannot stand. Moreover, the
sense requires not χαίρειν καὶ καὶ νσεῖν but
χαίρειν καὶ νοσοῦντι, or, in a synonymous
phrase, καὶ νόσῳ ξυνόντι: Ο. Τ. 303 οἴᾳ

to χλίειν is unnecessary.</p>
<p>For the general sense H. quoted Menand.

<p>He also urged, as against nauck's
reading, that iirucpvirreaOai. rather than
ἀποκρύπτεσθαι is the vox propria in the
sense of to cloak: but the inference is by
no means certain. Cf. Eur. fr. 416 (Stob.

is found. Bruno Keil (Herm. XXIII 379)

<p>Fr. 93 confirms the view generally held that the story of the
play is to be found in Hygin. fab. 91, and is therefore similar
to that of the Alexandras of Euripides, which was put on the
with the Troades in 415 B.C. When Hecuba was pregnant
with Paris, she dreamed that she gave birth to a flaming torch,
from whit h a number of snakes crawled forth. The diviners held
that the welfare of Troy depended on the destruction of the child
to be born. Consequently, when Alexandras was born, he

content to expose him, with the result that he was discovered by
pherds, who him as their own son, and called
him by the name Paris, Pai to maturity among the

bulls. At length Priam determined to celebrate funeral ga
in honour of his child long since lost, and sent some of his
its to choose a bull as prize for the victor in one of the

clown, drew his sword upon him; but Paris took refuge at the
altar of Ζεὺς eptceios. Cassandra then declared that the newcomer
was her brother, and Priam recognised his son (by means
of certain crepundia1, according to Serv. on Verg. Aen. 5. 370),
and welcomed him to the palace. Of course there is nothing to
connect Sophocles with any particular details in the above
account; and we are not in a position to distinguish the treatment
of Euripides from that of Sophocles.</p>
<p>Robert (Bild und Lied, pp. 233 — 239) undertook to show
that the story concerning the dream of Hecuba and the exposure
of Paris, his rescue and ultimate restoration to his home, was
not, as Welcker believed (Ep. Cycl. II 90), contained in the
Cypria, but was the invention of the fifth century, and in all
probability of Sophocles in the Alexandros, in the composition of
which he was largely influenced by the Herodotean account of
the youth of Cyrus (1 108 ff.). He had an easy task in
demolishing the argument by which Welcker attempted to
establish the indispensability of the story to the narrative of the
Cypria, viz. that the circumstances of the judgment of Paris
presuppose his residence on Ida, and that this in its turn implies
his escape from exposure; for his adoption of a pastoral life was
in no way inconsistent with his recognition as one of the princely
family of Priam. But there is a wide gap between the admission
that the origin of the story cannot be traced to the Cypria
and the conclusion that Sophocles was its author. Even if
Robert is correct in his inference from Tro. 919 fif. and Androm.
293 fif. that in the latter passage Euripides followed an older and
simpler version, according to which Hecuba refused to surrender
Paris to death, notwithstanding the vaticinations of Cassandra —
a conclusion which is by no means certain — it helps very little
towards the result which Robert desired to establish. Moreover,
the discovery of the fragments of ’s Paeans has destroyed
the foundation of ’s theory; for in 8. 27 fif. there is an
unmistakable allusion to ’s dream. But, apart from this,
the onus of strictly proving their case lies on those who seek to
show that any tragic plot was invented by its author; if even
Euripides, so far as we can tell, never dared to do anything
of the kind, we may be quite sure that Sophocles was far less
likely to make the experiment.</p>
<p>It will be observed that Hyginus states that Alexandros was
the name originally given to the child, and that Paris was
<note type="footnote">1 The detail is suggestive of a tragic origin, and is referred by Ahrens to Euripides.
On the other hand, there seems to be no reason for tracing to Sophocles the statement
of Asclepiades (FHG III 303) that the slave who exposed Paris was called
Archialos (Agelaus, according to Apollod. 3. 149).</note>

substituted by the shepherds. The exact opposite is asserted by
Eur. fr. 64 : cf. Enn. trag. fr. 38, Ov. Her. 16. 358 and perhaps
Eur. I.A. 1293 (Murray). Apollodorus (3. 150) says that the
shepherds who originally found him called him Paris, and that
his exploits subsequently earned for him the name of Alexandros.

Euripides?</p>

The authority of the word is considerably
strengthened by the new evidence; and
there is no longer any probability in
’s suggestion (p. 341 1) that it
was formed from the name Amalthea.
Rather we should suppose that the noun
and verb existed side by side, and that
the idea of abundance or plenty was personified
or deified in the various forms
familiar to Greek legend. It should be
observed that the earliest allusions to
Amalthea (Pind. in schol. Horn. Φ 194
Pherecydes fr. 37, FHG 182) represent her
as a nymph in whose possession was the
horn of plenty, and that the Cretan legend
οἱ the goat Amalthea which suckled Zeus
is attested only by later writers. That is
to say, the name Amalthea appears at a
comparatively late date to have been
transferred to the nameless Αἴξ οὐρανία
(Zenob. 1. 26, 2. 48). Further, the fact
that κέρας ἀμαλθείας was an attribute
of various deities (Wernicke in Pauly-
Wissowa I 1721) indicates that Amalthea
was not a distinctively conceived personality.
The etymology of Amalthea is
uncertain, and the suggestions which have
been put forward (collected by Gruppe,
p. 8249) are not satisfactory. But the
meaning points to a connexion with ἀμαλός
and ἀμάλη (= ἡ τριχῶν αὔξησις Etym.

<p>θηλάστρια. For the formation of these
feminine nomina agentis see Brugmann,
Comp. Gr. 11 p. 336 E. tr. θηλάστρια is
formed from θηλαξω, and may be compared
with εὐνήτρια (besie εὐνἡτειρα for
εὐνητερ ια) and αὐλήτρια. The word is
quoted from the comic poets, and is
certainly not exclusively Ionic in usage.
It appears however that in the κοινή the
verb θηλάξω came to mean to suck, Paris.
although in classical Greek it was regularly
applied to the mother. This fact is
noticed in Suidas and Photius, for whose
readers the ancient usage required explanation.
Hence Photius (p. 90, 24)
explains θηλάστραν by ἤν θηλάσεταί
τις from the point of view of his own age,
and his gloss on θηλάζειν sufficiently
accounts for Hesychius calling θηλάστρια
an Ionism: τὸ τρέθειν τῷ γάλακτι οἰ

<p>ΑΛΗΤΗΣ</p>
<p>The title is only quoted by Stobaeus (floril.), and by him
always as ἀλείτης. A tragedy with the title Ἀλοήτης is attributed
to Lycophron by Suidas s.v.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that the title-role belongs to Aletes,
the son of Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra, and that Welcker
(p. 215) was right in finding the substance of the plot in Hygin.
fab. 122. The story there related is as follows. Electra received
a false message that Orestes and Pylades had been sacrificed to
Artemis atTauri. Aletes, the son of Aegisthus, on learning that no
survivor of the race of the Atridae was left, usurped the sovereignty
at Mycenae. Electra set out to Delphi to enquire of the
oracle concerning her ’s death. On the same day that
she reached her destination, Iphigenia and Orestes also happened
to arrive; and the same messenger who had brought the news
about Orestes pointed out Iphigenia as his murderess. Hearing
this, Electra snatched a blazing brand from the altar, and in her
ignorance would have blinded Iphigenia, but for the timely inter-
ference of Orestes. A recognition followed, and they returned
together to Mycenae. Here Orestes killed Aletes, and would
also have slain his sister Erigone, had not Artemis carried her
away and made her a priestess in Attica. Orestes then married
Hermione, and Pylades Electra.</p>
<p>Welcker conjectured that fr. 646 belongs here, thinking that
Tyndareus appeared as the guardian of Aletes, and held that frs.
104, 105 are part of a dialogue between Aletes and Orestes.</p>
<p>Ribbeck (Röm. Trag. p. 469) finds the same plot in
Agamemnonidae of Accius. Whereas Welcker saw in Hyginus
sufficient material for two tragedies, Ribbeck preserved the unity
of place by supposing that Aletes and Erigone went to Delphi
in furtherance of a plot against Orestes and Iphigenia. Com-
paring frs. 101 — 103 with Agamemnonidae fr. II he thinks that
Aletes was represented as a hypocritical and specious talker.
Fr. 107 suits the circumstances of Agamemnon's and Aegisthus'
children.</p>
<p>For the proposed identification with the Erigone see p. 173.
Hense has recently revived a suggestion originally made by
Bergk that the Aletes was a late play. He is thus able to account
for the Euripidean tone of fr. 107. He points out that εἰς
ἔλεγχον ἐέναι (fr. 105) is used by Sophocles only in the Philoctetes
and Oedipus Coloneus, and that fr. 104 echoes O.C. 75.</p>

need for R. Enger's conjecture λόγῳ in

Holzner's πόμος. The fragment is supposed
to come from a dialogue between
Aletes and Orestes: see Introductory
Note.</p>
<p>1 εἴπερ. The force of this conjunction
has been exhaustively examined by E. S.
Thompson on Plato Meno, p. 258 ff.
He shows that si modo (fr. 86 n.) is the
principal, but not the only meaning, and
that there are many instances in which
(as here) εἴπερ assumes the truth of the
supposition it introduces. For the present
passage cf. Ai. 547 εἴπερ δικαίως ἔστ᾿ ἐμὸς
τὰ πατρόθεν, Plat. Lach. 197 C φημὶ γάρ
σε εἷναι σοφόν, καὶ Λάμαχόν γε, εἴπερ ἔστε

refute him.</p>

or ἤ &#x003C;οὐ&#x003E; &#x003C;οὐ&#x003E;
Blaydes makes several guesses, none of
which has any probability. I believe
that ’s attractive μέγ᾿ ἄν has led to a
darkening of counsel, and that what
Sophocles really affirmed was that great
prosperity is of little or no account be-
cause of its instability. This meaning is
obtained by substituting οὐ for the first ἢ
with ’s ἂν for δὴ and Cobet's
alteration in v. 2. The sentiment is then
exactly the same as that of fr. 593 οὐ χρή

Schmidt that this fragment has been

169 δεινόν γε τὸν κἡρυκα τὸν
παρὰ τοὺς βροτοὺς οἰχβθενον εἰ μηδέποτε
νοστήσει πάλιν. Sometimes the effect of
ronger emphasis on the
adjective than in the instances just cited:
see Tcbb on Phil. 1225. — The addition
of τ΄ (see cr. n.) after κακῶν has met with
general approval, but I believe it can be
unnecessary, if not actually
harmful. Presumably those who accept
τ΄ reganl δυσσεβεῖς and κακῶν ἄπο βλασ
τόντας as co-ordinate, and the whole phrase
(??) by the articular τούς. But
nsequence, though this has not been
ike εῖτα solecisti
though Sophocles frequently empl(??)
after a participle
v), he could not do so where
the participle is attributive and not circumstantial.
The fart is that τοὺς μὲν should
be taken alone, =some) τοὑς δ᾿ = others;
and δυσσεβεῖς coalesces with βλαστὁντας
as part of the predicate. Cf. El. 440
iXacrdru is little more than
re and in the
ly parallel Ai. 1304 ἄριστος ἐξ
ἀριστέοιν δυοῖν βλαστών, i.e. ‘born as the
lien of wi(??)
might hare been used, as
εὐσεβεῖς κὰξ εὐσεβῶν βλαστόντας, but it is
unnecessary to introduce it — τούσδε resumes
τοὺς μὲν with a certain rhetorical
impressivencss. Cf. Trach. 819 τὴν δὲ
τέρψιν ἤν | τώμῷ διδωσι πατρί, τήνδ᾿ αὐτὴ

<p>3 ἅμα is suspected by Nauck, but I
can see no more objection to it here than
e.g. in Ai. 1008 σὸς πατὴρ ἐμός θ᾿ ἅμα, —
ἐκ is used indifferently with dwo in v. 1.
For the ordinary distinction see jebb on

<p>There is no doubt that the correct form of the name in
classical times was Ἀλκμέων rather than Ἀλκμαίων, as can be
proved from the inscriptions both on stone both on vases: see
the evidence quoted by Meisterhans3 p. 35.</p>
<p>Alcmaeon was one of the stock heroes of tragedy (Arist.
poet. 13. 1453a 20), and is represented as the typical madman:
cf. Timocles fr. 6 (II 453 K.), 8 τοὺς γὰρ τραγῳδοὺς πρῶτον, εἰ
βούλει, σκόπει | ὡς ὠφελοῦσι πάντας...ὁ νοσῶν δὲ μανικῶς Ἀλκμέων᾿
ἐσκέψατο. There are two considerations which enable us to
narrow the enquiry relating to the contents of the plot: (1) the
fact that Sophocles also wrote plays1 entitled Ἐπίγονοι and
Ἐριφύλη; (2) fr. 1 108 shows that Alcmaeon had not yet recovered
his reason. We may safely infer that the events on which
the play is based were subsequent to the death of Eriphyle,
while her son was still pursued by the Erinyes of his mother, and
before he was finally released from suffering. Welcker (p. 279),
who with high probability refers fr. 880 to the prologue of this
play, builds on it a reconstructed plot with greater confidence
than the facts warrant. Nevertheless, if we examine the legends
with which Alcmaeon is connected, and exclude for the reason
already given his revenge on his mother for his father's death,
and his share in the expedition of the Epigoni, as well as the
Corinthian episode dramatized by Euripides in his Ἀλκμέων διὰ
Κορίνθου (TGF p. 379) as being entirely disconnected from the
healing of the ’s madness, we are forced to conclude that
Sophocles must have utilized either the adventures at Psophis or
those in Acarnania2. If we admit the relevance of fr. 880, only
one answer is possible; but, even apart from that, there can
be but little doubt as to the higher dramatic value of the Psophisstory,
which Euripides also treated. It is conjectured but not
proved that it was contained in the epic Thebais, or rather in
the Epigoni, which is now regarded not so much as a separate
poem as a subdivision of the Thebais (Bethe, Theb. Heldenlieder,
p. 137). Our principal sources of information are Pausan.
8. 24. 8 ff. and Apollod. 3. 87 ff.3. From them we learn that
<note type="footnote">1 Or a play entitled Epigoni containing the story of Eriphyle: see Introd. to

He goes on to describe the prayer of Callirrhoe that her
sons might be immediately brought to manhood, in order to avenge thctr their (??)
murder. The sequel is related by Apollodorus, but is hardly relevant to the play of
Sophocles.</note>

<pb n="69"/>
Alcmaeon, pursued by the avenging spirit of his mother, came to
Psophis in Arcadia, where Phegeus the king purified him and
gave him his daughter Alphesiboea (Arsinoe, according to
Apollod.) to wife. Alcmaeon gave to her the famous necklace
and robe of Harmonia. His madness, however, was not allayed,
and Alcmaeon was commanded by the Delphic oracle to settle
in a new land which had been left left by the sea since the
pollution of the murder. Accordingly he went to the delta
of the Achelous, where new land was continually being
by the silting of the river; and there he settled and married
Callirrhoe, the daughter of the river-god. But his new wife
sighed for the necklace and would not be comforted, until
Alcmaeon promised to return to Psophis and fetch it for her.
Arriving at Psophis, he pretended to Phegeus that the oracle
required the dedication of the necklace at Delphi as a condition
of his release from the madness1; Phegeus believed the story
and handed it over. One of ’s attendants, how
betrayed the secret about Callirrhoe, with the result that he was
waylaid and killed by the of of Phegeus at their ’s
bidding. To Propertius (1. 15. 15) we owe a dramatic touch
which does not appear in the other authorities, — although
Apollodorus gives a hint of ’s disagreement with her
brothers: Alphesiboea sitos ulta est pro coniuge fratres, | sanguinis
ri vincula rupit amor2. Perhaps then, as Welcker
Alcmaeon was given a more creditable rdle than is indicated by
account of Apollodorus. It may be added that fr. 108
tly fits the situation, if we suppose it spoken by Phegeus or
Alphesiboea in answer to ’s request for the 1
when he alleged that it was required for the god. If the right
view has been taken above, it is clear that Valckenaer (Diatr.
p. 150) was wrong in referring Tr. fr. adesp. 358 to this play. If
written by Sophocles at all, the verses elong rather to the
Libbeck (p. 495) thought3.</p>

canvassed, and Campbell condemns the
’ unmeaning tautology ’ of the text. Thus
Cobet ejected εὖ φρονήσαντ᾿ as a gloss,
Ribbeck corrected it to εὐτυχήσαντ᾿ , F. W.
Schmidt to οὐ φρονήσαντ᾿ , Wecklein to
ἀφρονήσαντ᾿, Gomperz to εὖ φρονήσαις,
and Nauck (in his earlier edition) to eS

to ignore such a chorus of suspicion, but
the text does not seem to me, if fairly
interpreted, to be in any way abnormal.
It should be observed (1) that εὖ φρονήσαντ᾿
is ingressive, as in Plat. Phaedr.

and not εὖ φρονήσαντ᾿ (= ὅταν εὖ
φρονήσῃς), is dependent on εἰσίδοιμι: for
the omission of ὢν as a supplementary
participle see Eur. Hclid. 332, Phoen.
1163, Her. 516, Goodw. § 91 1, Starkie on
Ar. Vesp. 1526. There is thus no necessity
for DindorPs Kal in place of ttwj, or
’s τ’ after φρενῶν. So far as the
redundancy of expression is concerned,
it is hardly more remarkable than in
Ant. 492 λυσσῶσαν αὐτὴν οὐδ᾿ ἐπήβολον

touch from Herodotus: see 3. 25 οἶα δὲ

<p>ΑΜΥΚΟΣ ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚΟΣ</p>
<p>This play related to an incident which happened on the
outward voyage of the Argonauts and is recounted among the
of Polydeuces. Amycus, the inhospitable king of the
Bebrycians in Bithynia, used to forbid all strangers to land on
and fetch water for their ships, until they had fought a
rig-match with him. Hitherto he had always killed his
Opponents, but when Argonauts arrived he met his conqueror
in Polydeuces (Apollod. I. 119, Hygin. fab. 17). The boxing-
match is described by Apoll. Rhod. 2. 1 — 97 and Theocr. 22.
—134. Whether these writers took any hints from Sophocles
it is impossible to say, but one point in which they differ is
vine of notice. According to Apollonius, with whom most
of the other authorities agree, Amycus was killed by Polydeuces;
but Theocritus (131 ff.) represents Polydeuces as sparing his life,
and merely requiring him to swear an oath by his father
Poseidon never to maltreat strangers in the future. Similarly.
according to BChoL Ap. Rhod. 2. 98, both Kpicharmus (fr. 7 K.)
and Periander Stated that he was put in chains. Such an ending
suitable to a satyr-play. We may conjecture that
atyrs were his slaves, and were liberated after the defeat of
their master1.</p>

<p>Whether κορῶναι in the second
of Athenaeus is a mistake for χελῶνας, or
vice versa, and in what connexion this
strange list was cited, it does not seem
possible to determine.</p>
<p>λαγοί is the plural of the Ionic λαγός,
answering to the Attic λαγώς. The fact
that it appeared in tragedy does not, of
course, justify its use in ordinary Attic
(Rutherford, New Phryn. p. 273).
Phrynichus says: λαγώς, ὁ Ἀττικός. διὰ
δὲ τοῦ ō ὁ Ἵων (p. 186 Lob.). See Weir
Smyth, Ionic dialect, § 478, K. Ζ. XXIX
109. The nom. λαγός is evidenced by the
acc. plur. λαγός in Hes. Scut. 302 τοὶ δ᾿

Σοφοκλῆς Ἀμύκῳ· ‘σιαγόνας...

iambic trimeter by placing δὴ after Tid-ycn;
and δὴ in this position and with temporal
meaning occurs in Trach. 460, Phil. 1065
and elsewhere (Eur. Hel. 134 n.). Mekler
thought that the metre might be trochaic
tetrameter. Blaydes preferred the order
τίθησι μαλθακάς, with σου for δὴ. H.,
however, suggests that μαλθακὰς τίθησι is
an ithyphallic following a trimeter, as in
Aesch. Prom. 610 γεγυμνάκασιν, οὐδ᾿ ἔχω
μαθεῖν ὅπῃ | πημονὰς ἀλύξω. The words
clearly describe the punishment inflicted
by one pugilist upon another. H. quotes

<p>ΑΜΦΙΑΡΕΩΣ ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚΟΣ</p>
<p>Tragedies bearing the title AmpJiiaraus were composed by
Carcinus (TGF p. 797) and Cleophon (Suid.), as well as comedies
by Aristophanes, Plato, Apollodorus of Carystus, and Philippides
(Kock I 396, 604, 111 280, 302).</p>
<p>It is difficult to guess which part of Amphiaraus' story
suitable for a satyr-play. A suggestion has been made in the
note on fr. 113, but there is no other evidence to confirm or rebut
it, and the words of the fragment itself are exceptionally obscure.
An alternative subject, which has perhaps more claim to consideration
on general grounds, would be the part taken by
Amphiaraus in the events which led to the founding of the
Nemean games. In that case the plot would cover the same
ground as the Nemea of Aeschylus (TGF p. 49) and the
Hypsipyle of Euripides (Ox. Pap. VI p. 21 ff.). The story of
the death of the child Opheltes or Archemorus, in whose honour
the games were founded, is told practically in the same form by
Apollod. 3. 64 — 66 and Hygin. fad. 74. The locality, a remote
fountain guarded by a dragon, was especially suitable to a satyrplay;
and the subject was clearly capable of lighter handling
than the fortunes of Amphiaraus at Argos or at Thebes.</p>

the pea-crab habitually resides in the
pinna, but does not countenance
the rest of the story. It remains
to ascertain how Sophocles made the
allusion relevant. Ellendt, who is followed
by Campbell (keeping χοροῦ),
absurdly supposes that a number of
μάντεις appeared in the play, and that
the shortest of them by a ridiculous
comparison was called πιννοτήρης. So
L. and S. interpret a tittle parasitical
fellow. But there is not the slightest
reason to suppose that Aristophanes was
parodying Sophocles, although, when the
comic poet says of the sons of Carcinus
(the Crab) ‘here’s the πινοτήρης οφ the
’ it is not difficult to infer that
the ‘baby-carb’ is meant. There was
no Carcinus in Sophocles, and, as we
can hardly refer τοῦδε μάντεως to anyone
but Amphiaraus, it seems likely that
Mcineke was right in restoring χορός
for χοροῦ. Even then the point of the
allusion is obscure; but the only situation
in the story of Amphiaraus, so far as it
is known to us, which might possibly
account for it, and would at the same
time be suitable foe treatment in a
play, is the incident related by H
fab. 73 (cf. Serv. on Vtqg. Aen. I
Myth. Vat. 1 152), how that Amphiaraus,
knowing that he would perish at Thebes,
concealed himself from Adrastus and the
rest with the conninance of Eriphylc, and
was subsequently discovered in consequence
of the treachery of his wife, who
was bribed by her brother with agolden
necklace. According to Stat. theb. 3.
570 ff. (cf. 606, 619), Amphiaraus hid
himself in his house, and refused to tell
the result his divination. May we suppose
that in such circumstances thr
chorus was posted outside i(??)

approach of danger? Welcker (Nachtr.

<p>ΑΜΦΙΤΡΥΩΝ</p>
<p>Euripides wrote an Alcmena, about which we have better
information than has been preserved concerning the Amphitryon
of Sophocles; for scholars are agreed that the chief dramatic
innovation introduced by Euripides was that Amphitryon
punished Alcmena for her supposed unfaithfulness by burning
her on a funeral-pyre, and that only the timely intervention of
Zeus rescued her from destruction: see Nauck, TGF p. 386
Wilamowitz, Eur. Herarl.2 I p. 54. Wernicke (in Pauly-
Wissowa I 1573) infers that Sophocles followed the earlier
version recorded by Apollod. 2. 61, according to which the
deception practised by Zeus and his intercourse with Alcmena
were made known to Amphitryon through the agency of Tiresias.
The old guess that the Amphitryon was a satyr-play (Osann in
Rh. Mus. 11 312) has nothing in its favour, unless indeed Porson's
view of fr. 1 127 is adopted. Accius wrote an Amphitryon, which
is thought to have been adapted from Sophocles, principally
because the only other tragedy so entitled was written by the
Alexandrian Aeschylus (TGF p. 824). In any case, the plot
may be taken to have covered the same ground as the wellknown
travesty of Plautus. Hartung and Schoell maintained
that both Sophocles and Accius dramatized the story of ’
Heracles under this title, but their view was rightly rejected by
Ribbeck (p. 557).</p>

C. from the schol., but the word
does not occur elsewhere. The adj. εὔσοος
is found in Theocr. 34. 8. Cf. Hesych.
II p. 233 εὔσοια· εὐθηνία, σωτηρία.</p>
<p>The meaning of this fragment is obscure.
Wclcker (p. 372) interpreted:
’when he is grown, to receive one of
these three provides ’ tie supposes
that Zeus promised to Heracles
three safeguards to protect him amidst
the ’Lingers of his life, one of which
be at any time sufficient to keep
him unharmed; and compares the golden
hair of ’terelatis. son of Taphius (Arollod.
2. 51), and for the triplication of the
three prayers of Theseus.
Hartung renders: ‘it suffices to find one
of your three roads to safety,’ but refrains
from explaining his meaning further.
Neither of these versions takes due account
of ἐπεὶ βλάστοι, which must be
regarded as a clause of general assump-
uh. 93 καὶ γὰρ ὐστέρῳ τὸ γ΄
εὑ | πράσσειν, ἐπεὶ πύθοιτο, κέρδος ἐμπολᾶ
(??) To substitute βλάστῃ, as Ellendt
and others have proposed, would
make no difference, unless apttl is taken
to be a dynamic (prophetic) present.
Bearing this in mind, I cannot help
suspecting that the word, may refer to
the miraculous growth of the heads of
the Lernaean Hydra (ἀμφίκρανον καὶ παλιμβλαστῆ
κύνα Kur. Her. 12741): ‘and,
whenever it grows, it is enough that one
οἱ the three should bee preserved.’ The
details of the story are variously rec
Alcaeus (fr. 118) spoke of nine heads,
Simonides (fr. 203) of fifty, and Euripides
(Her. 1188) of a hundred; and the
later authorities have the same or similar
nariations. Thus it would not be surprising
to find that Sophocles mentioned
an outcrop od three heads at a time, one
of which always survived. And there is
a further detail in the mythological handboods
which would help to explain the
text. Besides the ordinary version that
two heads grew for every one cut off,
Apollodorus (2. 77) relates that of the
nine heads eight were mortal, but the
middle one was immortal (τὰς μὲν ὀκτὼ
θνητάς, τὴν δὲ μέσην ἀθάνατον): see also
ib. 80, Pcdias. 7. Similarly, Sristonicus
of Tarentum (FHG IV 337), a writer
of uncertain date, said that ‘the middle
head’ was golden.</p>

and has no explanatory gloss, the 
seems inevitable that ἄτμητον 
has dropped out before it, and that 
Sophocles used this word in the Am- 
phitryon with the meaning invylnerable. 
This was practically the view of Salma- 
sius, who arranged the words ἄτμητον·
ἀμέριστον, ἀτραυμάτιστον. Σ. Ἀ. The
gloss ἀμέεριστον is probably a reference
to Plat. Phaedr. 277 B. That ἀτραυμά-

is shown by Etym. M. p. 110, 52 ἀνού-

gestion that σοφ. Ἀμφ. refers to a previous

fr. 520), and as Andromache is a character who may very well
have appeared in that play, Welcker (p. 113) concludes that
there was no such play as the Ἀνδρομάχη, and that fr. 125
really refers to the Ποιμένες. For errors due to the citation of a

cannot be reconstructed to the same extent as is possible with
the more famous Andromeda of Kuripides. The plot of Euripides
s nothing of a previous betrothal to Agenor (or Pbineus):
Cepheus refuses the proposal of Perseus on other grounds, and
pposition is overcome by the appearance of Athena ἀπὸ
μηχανῆς. It has been suggested1 that Sophocles followed the
on of the denouement adopted by Hygin. fad. 64, according
to which Cepheus and Agenor lay in wait for Perseus in order
to slay him, but Perseus by showing them the Gorgon's head
turned them into stone. But it is difficult to understand how the
of Sophocles found its way into the astronomical handbook,
if there was nothing in his play to support the statement that
the chief characters in the story were turned into stars. It
should be observed that although the story of Perseus and
Andromeda is not old — at least there is no trace of it in literature
e the fifth century — it was already current at the time of the
an wars, if we may lay any weight upon tin- statement
of Herodotus (7. 150) that Xerxes claimed kinship with the
Argives, as the descendant of Penes, the son of Perseus and
Andromeda. It is improbable that ’hrynichus had introduced
Andromeda into one of his plays, as Dobrce inferred from
Ar. Xub. 556. The reference there is to a comedy: see schol.
R and Starkie’s note.</p>
<p>Brunck, following Casaubon, considered that ’
Andromeda was a satyr-play; but his opinion was founded on BO
ger reason than the evidence afforded by fr. 136. Ribbcck,
- the same view öm. Trag. p. 163,6,), thinks that
7 has a comic tone and also refers to fr. 132; but his mam
1 is that Euripides' play would not have been regarded
as a startling nonelty — as it undoubtedly was — if Sopo

Sophocles from a hydria in the British Museum (E 169) which is
undoubtedly earlier than 412 B.C., the date of ’ play,
and is consequently inferred to have been influenced y Sophocles.
The painting shows Perseus arriving on foot, whereas in the
works of art which follow Euripides he descends from the air;
Cepheus weeping for his daughter's fate; posts being fixed into
the ground, to which Andromeda is to be lashed; and funeral
offerings carried by slaves, as if the ’s daughter were already
dead. But most stress is laid upon the figure of an effeminate
oriental supported by two attendants, who is identified with
Phineus1, the plighted lover of Andromeda. From these
materials Petersen draws the inference that the characters of the
cowardly barbarian who abandoned his betrothed, and of the
heroic Greek who rescued her, were brought into strong contrast
at an early stage of the action, and that the subsequent conflict
between Perseus and the barbarians was due not to the opposition
of Cepheus, but to the renewal of his claim by Phineus after the
rescue of the heroine. Petersen further contends that Accius
followed Sophocles in his Andromeda, whereas Ennius had as
usual copied Euripides; but even if he is right, the Latin
fragments are. too ambiguous to assist his general argument.
The value of the archaeological evidence must be left for others
to determine2; but the attempts by means of it to establish a
connexion with Eur. Alc. 611 ff., and to interpret fr. 130 as
referring to funeral vases, and fr. 133 as a description of Phineus
yoked to his attendants cannot be approved.</p>

is surprising that E. Mueller, quoted by
Hartung, should have taken the use of
ναυστολεῖν to be evidence of the satyric
character of the play.</p>

Ἀνδρομέδᾳ τιθεὶς οὕτω·
‘μηδὲν...ἐπιστολάσ.’</p>
<p>Rutherford preferred the variant φοβεῖσθε,
and there is nothing to decide for
one as against the other. Naber plausibly
suggested that the words μηδὲν φοβεῖσθαι
are part of Phrynichus' statement, and
not belong to Sophocles at all; but in
that case some alteration of the text
would be necessary.</p>
<p>It is curious that Phrynichus should
have had so much difficulty in finding
an example πρόσφατος in the metaphorical
sense, which, as Lobeck points
out, is fairly common. It should, however,
be observed that the metaphor is
vigorous in Aesch. Cho. 800 λύσασθ᾿
αἷμα προσφάτοις δίκαις, and in Pind.
Pyth. 4. 299 εὗρε παγὰν ἀμβροσίων ἐπέων |
πρόσφατον Θήβᾳ ξενωθείς, of fresh
water, where all the editors take πρόσφατον
as an adverb, although Lobeck had
indicated the true view. So in Dem. 21.
112 πρόσφατος is contrasted with ἕωλα
καὶ ψυχρά, but in Lys. 18. 19 ἔτι τῆς
ὀργῆς οὔσης προσφάτου the metaphor is
full-grown. Even to Zeno and the Stoics,
who defined Xbirri as δόξα πρόσφατος κακοῦ
παρουσίας (fr. 143 of my ed., I 212 Am.),
the metaphor was probably still living.
In later Greek it became worn-out: see
Holden on Plut. Them. 24.</p>

<p>μάσθλτα δίγονον had received two
traditional explanations, (1) as a double
lash, (2) as a lash stained with blood in
addition to its original colour. We need
not hesitate to prefer the former, which
is established by Ai. 241 μέγαν ἱπποδέτην
ῥυτῆρα λαβὶων | παίει λιγυρᾷ μάστιγι διπλῇ
It appears from the epithet λιγυρᾷ that
Sophocles understood the Homeric μάστιξ
as a whip rather than a goad: see Λ 532.
Notwithstanding the contrary opiions of
Verrall and Tucker (on Theb. 595), it
seems impossible to avoid the conclusion
that διπλῃ μάστιγι in Ag. 647, and διπλῆς
μαράγνης in Cho. 374, refter to a double
lash, and that Leaf (on ψ 387) sim mistaken
in extending the inference which he draws
from Homeric usage to the language of
the tragedians. On the other hand, it
will be observed that these passages do
not relate to the driving of chariots, and
it is certain that goads (El. 718, Eum.
156, Eur. Hipp. 1194, I. A. 220, Phoen.
182, Her. 881, 949) with a double point
(O. T. 809) were employed for that purpose.
The only passage in tragedy where
it might plausibly be urged that μάστιξ=
κέντρον is Ai. 1253; and there Jebb
renders it whip. herwerden (Mnem. XVII
265) proposed δίτονον, not without reason;
for there is nothing in the use of δίγονος,
τρίγονος, διφυής, etc. which supports their
extension to other than natural
multiplication</p>

Ἀνδρομέδᾳ αὐτοχείλεσι ληκύθοις (λίθοις
cod. C) ἔφη, δηλῶν ἀλαβάστους μονολίθους.</p>
<p>Hemsterhuis conjectured αὐτολίθοισι
ληκύθοις, and Wakefield αὐτοκόλλοις
ληκύθοις; but there is no ground for these
suspicions. αὐτοχαλέσι indicates that
the rim of the flask or pot was of the
same material as the rest of the vessel.
It was the custom to gild the edges of
silver cups, or to cover horn with silver:
cf. Aesch. fr. 185 ἀργυρηλάτοις | κέρασι
χρυσᾶ στόμια προσβεβλημένοις, quoted by
Athen. 476 C. Similarly Theopompus ἐν
δεθτέρᾳ Φιλιππικῶν (FHG 1 285 ap. Athen.
l.c. D) says that the kings of the paconians
τῶν βοῶν τῶν παρ᾿ αὐτοῖς γινομένων μεγάλα
κέρατα φυόντων, ὡς χωρεῖν τρεῖς καὶ τέτ.
ταρας χόας, ἐκπώματα ποιεῖν ἐξ αὐτῶν, τὰ
χείλη περιαργυροῦντας καὶ χρυσοῦντας.
But the practice was as old as Homer:
δ 615 δώσω τοι κρητῆρα τετυγμένον.
ἀργύρεος δὲ | ἔστιν ἄπας, χρυσ ῷ δ᾿ ἐπὶ χείλεα
κεκράανται, ib. 132. Thus the compound
means ῾with natural rims,᾿ and the whole
phrase is exactly parallel to αὐτόκωπα
βέλη in Aesch. Cho. 163, weapons whose
hilt is in one piece with the blade.
Similar are αὐτοκτίτους δόμουτ fr. 332.

quoted in the n. on Eur. Hel. 356.—
αὐτοχειλέσι is the regular accentuation, as
Blaydes points out: see Chandler, § 698 ff.
But Nauck and Dindorf print αὐτοχείλεσι,
following, I suppose, the tradition in
Pollux.</p>

(Pauly-Wissowa 1 1953) thinks that boats

<p>ἀμφίπρυμνον. This adjective is applied
to vessels which for various reasons were
so constructed that they could be propelled
in either direction without turning. Dio

καὶ ἐπιπλέωσι καὶ ἀναχωρῶσι, καὶ τοὺς

built such boats for his campaign: Tac.
Ann. 4. 6 plures adpositis utrimque gubernaculis,
converso ut repente remigio hinc
vel illinc adpellerent. They were also
used by the Germans (Tac. Germ. 44)
and by the inhabitants of the coasts of
the Euxine (Hist. 3. 47). Athen. 204 A, E
mentions certain vessels of Ptolemy Philopator,
one of these a state barge, which
he describes as δίπρῳροι and δίπρυμνοι;
and it is inferred that they also were
of this kind, although Schweighauser
thought otherwise (vol. xi p. 232 on
489 B, where a δίπρῳρος is compared to a
cup παρακειμένως ἔχοντα τὰ ὦτα). I take
this opportunity of remarking, in view of
the explanations still given in some books,
that the meaning of ἀμφῆρες δόρυ in Eur.
Cycl. 15 and ἀκάτιον ἀμφηρικόν in Thuc.
4. 67 is fixed by the schol. on the latter
passage (ἐν ᾧ ἕκαστος τῶν
δικωπίᾳ ἐρέττει); they were sculling-boats,
and were named ἀμφήρη because each
one of the crew propelled the vessel on
both sides. See also Blaydes on Ar.
Eccl. 1091. Is it possible that the κῆτος
was compared to an ἀμφίπρυμνον πλοῖον,
because he could so readily shift himself
to meet an attack from any quarter? He
is compared to a ship rushing through
the waves in Ov. Met. 4. 706. [I have
since learnt that the suggestion has been
anticipated for the same reason by Petersen:
see Introductory Note.]</p>

<p>M. Schmidt maintained that the form
ἀμβλύσκω was an error, and that either
ἀμβλίσκω (Plat.) or ἀμβλώσκω (Suid.)
should be substituted. Lobeck, Phryn.
p. 210, refused to condemn ἀμβλύσκω as
a possible derivative from ἀμβλύς; and
the evidence does not warrant a dogmatic
conclusion. All we can say is that
ἀμβλίσκω and ἐξαμβλοῦν are the bestattested
forms, and that ἐκτιτρώσκειν is
Ionic and Hellenistic. Both Lobeck and
Rutherford (p. 289) make the strange
mistake of assigning ἐκτιτρώσκειν to
Sophocles on the strength of the above
passage of Hesychius. But it is obviously
part of the explanation attached to
ἀμβλύσκει (or ἀμβλίσκει). Cf. Hesych. II

<p>So the etract is given by Nauck, without
stating his authority. Duebner gives
the opning words as τοὺς ατύρους οί
πλείουές φασιν, and notes that EU have
καὶ σατυρίσκους τοὺς Πᾶνας οἱ πλείους
φασίν, ὡς καὶ τοὺς Σειλινοὺτ καὶ τοὑς
σατύρους. Dindorf prints τοὺς σατύρους
ἀκρατεῖς οἰ πλείουές φασιν. where the
additon of ἀκρατεῖς is due to a conjecture
of Casaubon. Nauck inferred that Sophocles
spoke of Sileni in the plural on the
ground that the authority of Aeschylus
is quoted, as other evidence shows, for
the existence of two Pans. But the subsequently
admitted (Index, p. xi) that the
true solution had been found by Wecklein
(Siteungib. d. K. B. Akad. 1890 1 p. 31),
and that we ought to read τοὺς Ηἄνατ...
σατύρονς, as printed in Ahrens's and
Ziegler's editions. The passage in
Theocritus runs: τό τοι γένοις ἧ Σατυρίσκοις
| ἐγγόθεν ἧ Πάνεσσι κακοκάμοισιν
ἐρίσδει. So soon as we consider what
comment is likely to have been made
on these words requiring the citation of
parallels, it becomes clear that the editor,
possibly theon himself, was defending the
use of Πἄνες in the plural by Thoeocritus.</p>

<pb n="86"/>
<p>The alternative offered by Casaubon's
restoration would be inconsistent with
the quotation from Aeschylus. Pan was
acknowledged by Herodotus (2. 145)
to be one of the youngest of the Greek
gods, and his name hardly appears in
literature beofer the fifth century B.C.
It seems highly probable that the generic
use of the name is actually the earlier,
and that Pan the god is developed and
individualized from the class of demonic
beings with whom the rustic fancy populated
the hills and forests of Arcadia.
The same history has been deduced for
the parallel conception of the Italian
Faunus: see Warde Fowler, Roman
Festivals, p. 260. For other early
evidence of the plural cf. Ar. Ecel. 1069
ὦ Πᾶνες, Plat. legg. 815c Νύμφας τε καὶ
Πᾶνας καὶ Σιληνοὺς καὶ Σατύρους ἐπονομάζοντες.
The Panisci, parallel to
σατυρίσκοι, are not mentioned before
Cicero (n. d. 3. 43), but this is probably
accidental. See also A. P. 6. 108 ὐψηλῶν

<p>ΑΝΤΗΝΟΡΙΔΑΙ</p>
<p>The follwing extract from Strabo (608) is usually referred
to the Antenoridae. ‘Sophocles says that at the capture of
Troy a leopard's skin was placed in front of the door of Antenor,
to serve as a warning that the house was to remin unscathed.
Accordingly, Antenor and his sons, together with the Eneti who
had joined them, found their way in safety to Thrace, and thence
escaped to the country called Enetica on the Adriatic. Then
also Aeneas, together with his father Anchises and his son
Ascanius, collected his followers and set sail1.’ The leopard's
skin was also mentioned in the Locrian Ajax (fr. 11). Pausanias
(10. 27. 3), describing the picture of Polygnotus in teh Lesche at
Delphi, which set forth the incidents belonging to the capture of
Troy, referred to the house of Antenor, with its leopard's skin
over the entrance; in front of it were represented Antenor and
his wife Theano (Hom. Z 298), with their sons Glaucus and
Eurymachus, and their daughter Crino and her infant The
leopard's skin is mentioned in the same connexion by schol.
Pind. Pyth. 5. 110.</p>
<p>In the same account (10. 26. 7, 8) Pausanias states that
Lesches in the Little Iliad (fr. 13 K) related the rescue by
Odysseus of Helicaon, another of Antenor's sons, when wounded
in the night-battle; and gives reasons for concluding that his
wife Laodice was exempted from the fate of the other Trojan
women. Apollodorus (epit. 5. 21) similarly recounts that Odysseus
and Menelaus, recognizing Glaucus the son of Antenor, as he
was fleeing to his house, saved him by force of arms. Pindar
(Pyth. 5. 83) followed the tradition that the Antenoridae settled at
Cyrene: ἔχοντι τὰν χαλκοχάρμαι ξενοι | Τρῶες Ἀντανορίδαι· σὺν

was so numerous that its migration might well have been in
more than one direction. Bacchylides spoke of them as fifty: schol.
Hom. Ω 496 πιθανὸν μίαν τεκεῖν ιθ΄, οὐχ ὡς Βακχυλίδης ν΄ τῆς
Θεανοῦς ὑπογράφει παῖδας. Homer names eleven: besides Coon,
Demoleon, Iphidamas, Laodamas, and Pedaeus, who were killed,
Acamas, Agenor, Archelochus, Helicaon, Laodocus, and Polybus1;
and Verg. Aen. 6. 483 has Glaucumque Medontaque Thersilochumque,
| tris Antenoridas, though these three are not so
specified in Homer P 216. A few other names besides those
which have been already mentioned appear in later writers.</p>
<p>The reasons which induced the Greeks to accord a special protecion
to Antenor are recorded in Qu. 13. 291 ff. and more briefly
in Tryphiod. 656 ff. τέκνα δὲ καὶ γενεὴν Ἀντήνορος ἀντιθέοιο |

Odysseus, when they came to Troy to demand the restoration of
Helen (Hom. Γ 207), and protected them from injury (schol.
ad loc.). He was the leader of the peace-party among the
Trojans, and had recommended the surrender of Helen and her
treasure (H 347 ff.; cf. Hor. Ep. 1. 2. 9); and his honied speech
was compared to that of Nestor: εἴ μοι τὸ Νεστόρειον εὔγλωσσον
μέλος |  Ἀντήνορός τε τοῦ Φρυγὸς δοίη θεός (Eur. fr. 899).</p>
<p>The tradition that Troy fell in consequence of the treachery
of Antenor has not been traced to any early writer2; and there
is no evidence to show that Sophocles was acquainted with it.</p>
<p>It is generally admitted that the passage in Strabo contains a
summary in brief of the plot of the Antenoridae2; for otherwise
the allusion cannot be traced to its source. It is scarcely to be
referred to the Locrian Ajax; for the incidents related by Strabo,
if included in the action, would have been incompatible with the
dramatic development of the fate of Ajax. There is, moreover,
a play of Accius with the same title; and it is unreasonable to
doubt that it was adapted from Sophocles (Ribbeck, Röm. Trag.
p. 406 ff.). The Latin fragments are more plentiful than the

enlarging our conception of the plot. From the story as
outlined above we receive no impression of dramatic conflict.
Antenor was saved by the Greeks in consideration of his past
services, and  that is all. But Accius has: ad populum intellego | 
referundum, quoniam horum aequiter sententiae |  fuere (fr. 1).
From this it was inferred by Welcker that the Greek view in
favour of Antenor was by no means unanimous, and that he was
saved from destruction only after a protracted conflict1. What
may have been the arguments on the one side or the other we
have no means of ascertaining; but the association of Antenor
with the Eneti is a circumstance which perhaps bore nearly on
the issue. In Homer this people are a Paphlagonian tribe
(B 852) under the leadership of Pylaemenes, and are reckoned
among the Trojan allies; but the fragments of Accius led
Welcker to conclude (p. 169) that a new leader had arrived with
a fresh contingent of Eneti just before the capture of teh city:
namque huc em venio ut mea ope opes Troiae integrem (fr. IV); qui
aut illorum copias | fundam in campo, aut navis uram, aut castra
mactabo in mare (fr. V.).</p>
<p>It will be noticed that, according to Strabo, Sophocles
recognised teh connexion of Antenor with the settlement of
Eneti (Veneti) in the north of Italy. We thus get an interesting
link with the Latin authorities: Liv. 1. 1 iam primum omnium
satis constat, Troia capta, in ceteros saevitum esse Troianos;
duobus, Aenea Antenoreque, et vetusti iure hospitii et quia pacis
reddendaeque Helenae semper auctores fuerunt, omne ius belli
Achivos abstinuisse, casibus deinde variis Antenorem cum multitudine
Henetum, qui, seditione ex Paphlagonia pulsi, et sedes et
ducem, rege Pylaemene ad Troiam amisso, quaerebatn, venisse
in intimum maris Hadriatici sinum, Euganeisque qui inter mare
Alpesque incolebant pulsis, Henetos Troianosque eas tenuisse terras:
et in quem primum egressi sunt locum Troia vocatur, pagoque inde
Troiano noment est, gens universa Veneti adpellati. Cf. Verg. Aen.
1. 242 ff. Further confirmation of Strabo's evidence is to be
found in Polyb. 2. 17. 6, who asserts that the tragic playwrights
told strange stories respecting the settlement of the Veneti (περὶ
ὧν οἱ τραγῳδιογράφοι πολύν τινα πεποίηνται λόγον καὶ πολλὴν
<note type="footnote">1 Ribbeck (p. 408) interprets differently. According to him, the referebce us to a
decision of the Trojan people, after the council had been equally divided on the
question whether a last attempt should be made to secure a friendly arrangement
by the surrender of Helen after the death of Paris; and here Antenor, as on earlier
occasions, was the advocate of peace. This seems less likely. Ahrens thought that,
though Antenor's life was spared, his treachery was condemned, and he was refused 
permission to settle in teh Troad. Therefore he was sent away with the Eneti, who,
owing to the lateness of their arrival, would feel no resentement against him.</note>

διατίθενται τερατείαν): in customs and dress, according to him,
these people closely resemble the Celts, but differ from them
in language. Strabo elsewhere (48, 150, 543) mentions the
settlement of Antenor and the Eneti as a common tradition, and
in 212 appeals in support of it to the fact that Dionysius of
Syracuse recruited his racing stable from Venetia, recalling
the line in Homer (l.c.) which connected the Paphlagonian Eneti
with ἡμιόνων γένος ἀγροτεράων (cf. Eur. Hipp. 231). For the
trade route between the Black Sea and the Adriatic see
Ridgeway, Early Age in Greece, I p. 366. According to
him, the Veneti were Illyrians, i.e. Pelasgian belonging to
the melanochrous dolichocephalous race indigenous in the
Mediterranean (ib. p. 377).</p>
<p>The omission of the laocoon and the inclusion of the Antenoridae
in the list of Trojan plays given in the Argument to the
Ajax (p. 3, ed. Jebb) suggested to Robert (Bild und Lied, p. 201)
the identification of the two titles; but he recognized that there
was much to be said on the other side. Fr. 373, as compared
with Strabo 608, indicates that the departure of Aeneas may
have been mentioned in both plays.</p>
<p>The fourteenth poem of Bacchylides is entitled Ἀντηνορίδαι
ἡ Ἑλένης ἀπαίτησις. Theano opens the door of Athena's temple
in order to receive Menelaus and odysseus on their embassy; 
and it is evident, in spite of a lacuna, that they are conducted by
the sons of Antenor, who goes himself to inform Priam. The
Trojans are summoned to the agora, and pray to the gods
for a cesstion of their sufferings. The debate is opened by
Menelaus with a brief warning that Zeus is not the author of
men's troubles; δίκη lies within the choice of all, while ὔβρις, her
opposite, leads to ruin and  destruction. At this point the ode
abruptly ends. Jebb (p. 220) remarks: ‘Blass and Wilamowitz
regard the bouble title of the Bacchylidean poen as making
it probable that the Ἀντηνορίδαι of Sophocles was only another
name for his Ἑλένης ἀπαίησις. Such a second title for the
tragedy is intelligible, however, only if the sons of Antenor
formed the chorus; but, in the case of such a drama, is that
probable? It may be necessary to find another solution for the
title Ἑλένης ἁρπαγή mentioned in the Argument to the Ajax in
place of the current hypothesis that it is an error for Ἑλένης
ἀπαίτησις.</p>

was sound, ‘to toss up as the sea does, or

βράσσω, βράζω and βρύζω, and held that
βαβράζω was related to βρύζω as παφλάζω

with sound (βρυχάομαι etc.) is

<p>ΑΤΡΕΓΣ Η ΜΥΚΗΝΑΙΑΙ</p>
<p>Τhis play cannot be considered apart from the title Thyestes
(p. 185). There is surprisingly little evidence for the existence
of an Atreus: Hesychius quotes Ἀτρεῖ ἢ Μυκήναις, and a scholiast
on Euripides refers to Μυκηναίαις. Τhe Thyestes is quoted
twenty-two times, for the most part simply under that title; but
Hesychius refers four times to Θυέστης Σικυώνιος, once to Θυέστης 
ὁ ἐν Σικυῶνι, and twice to Θυέστης δεύτερος, and Orion cites
ἐκ τοῦ α΄ Θυέστου. On three plays dealing with the gruesome
legends concerning the two brothers; that the famous incidents
of the golden lamb and the Thyestes-feast occurred in the
Atreus; and that the plays entitled Thyestes related to the
unnatural intercourse of Thyestes with his daughter, and the
fatal issue by which Aegisthus became the appointed avenger of
his father (Welcker, pp. 357—370). The problem is unusually
intricate, and it is hardly possible from the existing data to
ascertain which parts of the traditional material were selected by
Sophocles for treatment. The fragments themselves, with the
possible exception of fr. 247, which seems to refer to the Sicyonstory,
do not give any assistance towards the unravelling of the
plots; and it is scarcely legitimate to draw any inference from
the more unmerous fragments of Accius, whose Atreusw (Aul.
Gell. 13. 2. 2) has been supposed to be an adaptation of Sophocles:
see especially the passages quoted by Cic. n. d. 3. 68, de orat.
3. 217, 219. For it must be remembered that Ennius had
already written a Thyestes; ann, while it is likely that both these
Roman tragedies dealt rather with the central motive of the
story than with its outlying incidents, we cannot believe that
Accius was cntent simply to reproduce the treatment of
Sophocles. Indeed, his know attitude towards his models
forbids such a conclusion: it is certian that in his Antigone
he departed widely from Sophocles, and his Philoctetes depended
on more than one orginal (Schanz, Röm. Litt. p. 76).</p>
<p>Hitherto it has not been convincingly shown that Sophocles
wrote more than two plays upon the story of the brothers, one
containging the events which occurred at Mycenac, and the other
the sicyon-story. Since everyone hearing the name Thyestes
at once recalls the banquet, the other part of his story when
referred to would naturally be distinguished as happing in
Sicyon, even though the banquet-play were know by the title
Atreus; and, on the other hand, it would not be unnatural for
the banquet-play, whatever its traditoinal title may have been, to

<pb n="92"/>
be referred to either as Thyestes or as Atreus. This may be
illustrated by Epict. diss. 1. 28. 32 καὶ ποία τραγῳδία ἄλλην
ἀρχὴν ἔχει; Ἀτρεὺς Εὐριπίδου τί ἐστι; τὸ φαινόμενον, which is
admitted to be a reference to the Thyestes of Euripides. For the
present, however, we may put aside the question of the contents
of the play (or plays) entitled Thyestes, except in so far as that 
title may have been an alternative for Atreus. No one denies
that Sophocles wrote a play covering much the same ground
as Seneca's Thyestes, whatever its exact title may have been.
The general ambit of these plays may be gathered from Dio
Chrys. 66. 6 (II p. 162 Arn.) ὅτι μὲν γὰρ διὰ χρυσοῦν πρόβατον
ἀνάστατον συνέβη γενέσθαι τηλικαύτην οἰκίαν τὴν Πέλοπος οἱ
τραγῳδοί δασιν. καὶ κατεκόπη μὲν τὰ τοῦ Θυέστου τέκνα, τῇ
Πελοπίᾳ δὲ ὁ πατηρ ἐμίχθη καὶ τὸν Αἴγισθον ἔσπειρεν...τούτοις
δὲ οὐκ ἄξιον ἀπιστεῖν, ἃ γέγραπται μὲν οὐχ ὐπὸ τῶν τυχόντων
ἀνδρῶν, Εὐριπίδου καὶ Σοφοκλέους, λέγεται δὲ ἐν μέσοις τοῖς
θεάτροις. We may also infer that the golden lamb was the
initial cause of the troble between the  brothers, according to
both tragedians, and in this respect they appear to have followed
the author of the Alcmaeonis (schol. Eur. Or. 997). Is it possible
to obtain a better estimate of the scope of the banquet-play?
The answer will depend upon the weight to be assigned to shcol.
rec. Eur. Or. 812 (Atreus and Thyestes, contending for the
throne, agreed that whichever could produce some divine sign
should prevail) ἐν τοῖς ποιμνίοις δὲ τοῦ Ἀτρέως εὕρηται χρυσοῦν
ἀρνίον μήνιδι Ἑρμοῦ...καὶ μέλλοντος Ἀτρέως δεῖξαι τὸ τέρας τοῖς
δικασταῖς, καὶ λαβεῖν τὴν ἀρχήν, Ἀερόπη ἡ τούτου γυνὴ μοιχευομένη
Θυέστῃ τῷ ἀνδραδέλφῳ, κλέψασα τοῦτο παρέδωκεν αὐτῷ.
Θυέστης δὲ λαβὼν τοῦτο καὶ δείξας τοῖς δικασταῖς, τῆς ἀρχῆς
ἐκράτησε. μὴ ἀνασχόμενος οὖν Ἀτρεὺς τὴν συμφοράν, ἀλλὰ
δυσχεραίνων, ὅτι ἀδίκως ἐστέρηται τῆς ἀρχῆς, ὁμοῦ τε τὴν γυναῖκα
Ἀερόπην τιμωρεῖται κατ᾿ ἄμφω, καὶ ὅτι ἐμοιχεύετο Θυέστῃ, καὶ
ὅτι κέκλοφε τὸ ἀρνίον καὶ δέδωκεν αὐτῷ, ῥίψας αὐτὴν εἰς θάλασσαν,
ὥς φησι Σοφοκλῆς, καὶ τοὺς τρεῖς υἱοὺς τοῦ Θυέστου, Ἀγλαον,
Ὀρχομενόν, καὶ Κάλεον, ἀποκτείνας παρέθηκεν εἰς τράπεζαν τῷ

παράνομον, μίαν ἡμέραν ἐκ δυσμῶν πρὸς ἕω διφρεύει κτἑ. The
notion of Atreus and Thyestes submitting their claims to a panel
of jurymen is certainly not old, but that the lamb was a mark of
divine favour and that its possessor was entitled to claim the
succession are propositions so well supported that they are much
more likely to belong to the original legend than the variant
recorded by Apollod. epit. 2. 10. Cf. Eur. El. 722 τέρας ἐκκομί|ζει

portento caelestum pater | prodigium misit, regni stabilimen
mei. Sen. Thyest. 230 possessor huius regnat, hunc cunctae domus |
fortuna sequitur. The purport of the reference to Sophocles has
been variously estimated. If it is intended for the Atreus, as
Dindorf and other scholars thought, we obtain a valuable clue to
the construction of that play; but it may be merely an inaccurate
reminiscence of Ai. 1295,—if indeed the vulgate text of that
passage is not corrupt (see Jebb's n.). Nauck evidently attached
no value to the scholium, which he omitted from his edition
of the Fragments. There is, however, a further indication in the
note, which can almost with certainty be assigned to Sophocles,
and which increases the probability that we have here a rough
outline of his plot. That is the statement that the alteration of
the sun's course wsa due to the sun-god's horror at the impious
feast. For this very thing is mentioned by Statyllius Flaccus in
his epigram in honour of Sophocles (A. P. 9. 98): Οἰδίποδες
δισσοί σε καὶ Ἠλέκτρη βαρύμηνις | καὶ δείπνοις ἐλαθεὶς Ἀτρέος
Ἠέλιος κτέ1. The same version was generally adopted by the
Latin poets (see, besides Sen. Thyest. 785 ff., Ov. Her. 16. 205,
Am. 3. 12. 39 aversumque diem mensis furialibus Atrei); but it is
more important to observe that it also occurs in Hygin. fab. 88,
which is connected with Sophocles for other reasons (see p. 185),
and in fab. 258. For another tale was current according to
which, after Thyestes by his treacherous and shameful plot had
temporarily obtained recognition as monarch, Zeus promised to
Atreus that the course of nature should be changed in his favour
and that he might promise this marvel to the people as a token
that he was the rightful heir (Apollod. epit. 2. 12). This was
accepted by Euripides (fr. 861 δείξας γὰρ ἄστρων τὴν ἐναντίαν
ὁδὸν | δήμους τ᾿ ἔσῳσα καὶ τύραννος ἰζόμην), and is apparently
referred to by Sophocles in fr. 738, where see note. Hence
Welcker (p. 361) was undoubtedly mistakn in  referring it to
some later tragedian. To later rationalists Atreus was an early
astronomer: Strabo 23, Lucian de astrol. 12.</p>
<p>It seems clear that Aristotle's allusions to Thyestes in poet. 13.
1453a 10 etc., whether they relate to Sophocles or to Euripides,
concern the banquet-play and not the story of Pelopia.</p>
<p>Welcker thought that Mυκηναῖοι should be restored as the
alternative title. The evidence is very slight, but, if the feminine
form is correct, it would follow that Aerope was one of the most
prominent characters.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 The importance of this passage was first pointed out by O. Crusius in Philet.
Suppl. VI 304 sq., but is overlooked by Escher in Pauly-Wissowa II 2143, who refers
to it. It is of course possbile that the epigrammatist was simpy alluding to the story
of Atreus in the form most familiar to him.</note>

R. A. Neil, who examined the

of the active, that it is prompted bymetrical
considerations, is surely unnecessary.
Though the middle naturally tended to 
assert itself, as the metaphorical meaning
became increasingly familiar (see
Wyttenbach on Plut. mor. p. 39 A), no
objection can be taken to the active, at
least so long as its original force remains
prominent. The use of φέρειν (e.g. El.
692) is exactly similar.</p>
<p>ΑΧΑΙΩΝ ΣΥΛΛΟΓΟΣ</p>
<p>Until quite recently it was generally held that Ἀχαιῶν
σύλλογος and Σύνδειπνοι were alternative titles of the same
play; but the reasons which appeared to support that conclusion
will be more conveniently considered in connexion with the
Σύνδειπνοι. The discovery of fr. 142 has entirely altered the
conditions of the problem. The internal evidence of that
fragment clearly indicated the story of the play to which it

<pb n="95"/>
belonged; and since the language appears to be that of Sophocles,
as is pointed out in the notes, the inference drawn by Wilamowitz
that it comes from the Ἀχαιῶν σύλλογος can hardly be resisted1.
Not only does no other title seem to fit the data, but the words
in col. ii 12 ποῦ᾿ στι σύλλογος φίλων; are a strong confirmation
of the proposed identification. Also ἐξετάξεται in v. 17 may be
compared with fr. 144.</p>
<p>The chief interest of the plot lay in the relations of Achilles
with Telephus. When the Greeks first sailed to Troy, through
ignorance of its real situation they landed in Mysia. Here
Telephus, who was king of the country, came out to meet them,
and killed Thersander the son of Polynices. But, fleeing before
Achilles, he became entangled in a vine-plant, and was woulded
by Achilled' spear. The Greeks retired, and were scattered by a 
storm; Achilles reached Scyros, where he ultimately married
Deidamia. At length the confederates assembled for a second
time at Argos. Meanwhile Telephus, whose wound refused to
heal, had visited Delphi and learnt from the oracle that he could
only be cured by the hand which had inflicted the would (ὁ τρώσας
ἰάσεται schol. Ar. Nub. 919). The sequel is described in Procl.
Cypr. (EGF p. 19) ἔπειτα Τήλεφον κατὰ μαντείαν παραγενόμενον
εἰς Ἄργος ἰᾶται Ἀχιλλεὺς ὡς ἡγεμόνα γενησόμενον τοῦ ἐπ᾿ Ἴλιον

αὐτῶν ἐν Ἄργει αὖθις μετὰ τὴν ῥηθεῖσαν ὀκταετίαν, ἐν ἀπορίᾳ τοῦ
πλοῦ πολλῇ καθεστήκεσαν, καθηγεμόνα μὴ ἔχοντες, ὃς ἤν δυνατὸς

<p>The story of the healing of Telephus formed the subject
of the famous play written by Euripides2 under this title and
produced in 438 B.C.; and the words τρύχεσιν ἠμφιεσμένος in
Apollodurus appear to be due to Euripidean influence (cf. fr. 697,
and Nauck, TGF p. 580). The ingenuity of the playwright, in
handling the drama, was taxe to solve the dramatic difficulty of
converting Telephus, a declared foe, into a trustworty friend.

Accroding to one account (Hygin. fab. 101), Telephus, in concert
with Clytaemnestra, seized the child Orestes from his cradle
before taking refuge at the alter, and threatened to kill him
unless his prayer was granted. When the Berlin papyrus was
first deciphered, Wilamowitz inferred from the reading Ὀρέστα
in col. i 2 that the incident formed part of Sophocles’ design,
but, now that Schubart has restored παρέστα, the inference falls
to the ground. It had already been argued by L. Pollak (Zwei
Vasen aus der Werkstatt Hierons, Leipzig, 1900) from a vasepainting, 
which he refers to a date earlier than 470 B.C., that the
Orestes-episode did not belong to the original version of the
story given in the Cypria. On the vase Telephus has taken
refuge at the altar: his right hand covers his wounded foot, and
his left hand is stretched out in the direction of a warrior
(Achilles) who has drawn his sword against him, while he looks
for protection to a seer (Calchas) who is approaching on the
right. Pollak's conclusion is entirely consistent with the 
statement of the schol. Ar. Ach. 332, attributing the Orestesepisode
to Aeschylus. Nauck (TGF p. 76) regards the insertion
of Aeschylus' name as a mere blunder, but, whereas most writers
have agreed in supposing that the seizure of the child was
introduced—if not for the first time—by Euripides, Wecklein
(Die dramatische Behandlung des Telephusmythus, München, 1909,
p. 16) has gone so far as to deny that it was mentioned by him
at all, except possibly by way of criticizing Aeschylus. However
this may be, there is no evidence connecting it with Sophocles,
and it is more agreeable to his usual procedure to suppose that
he adhered as closely as possible to the narrative to the κύκλος
(Athen. 277 D). It is a fair inference that the action of the
play took place at Argow, and the new fragment indicates
that the reconciliation with the Greeks had already been
achieved. The words σὲ γὰρ Τεγεᾶτις . . . ἁλίων ἐρετμῶν (col. ii
7—10) may be taken to show that the Greek origin of Telephus
had been established, and that the Greeks had accepted him
as their destined pilot to the Trojan coast in accordance with an
oracle imparted to them by Calchas. We may compare Hyginus
(l.c.): Achivis autem quod responsum erat, sine Telephi ductu
Troiam capi non posse, facile cum eo in gratiam redierunt et ab
Achille petierunt, ut eum sanaret. It remained only to satisfy the
requirements of the oracle given to Telepus (Ὁ τρώσας ἰάσεται),
and for this purpose the words addressed by Odysseus to Achilles
are significant—ἐν δέοντι δ᾿ ἦλθες, ὦ παῖ Πηλέως. Odysseus was
chosen for his discretion to negotiate with Achilles, who had not
arrived at the beginning of the play (cf. fr. 144). We cannot tell
how he gained his point, but it seems unlikely that the discovery

<pb n="97"/>
of Telephus' origin was the chief factor in persuading Achilles to
give his assistance. The course of the subsequent dénouement
is perhaps to be traced, as Wecklein (p. 20) suggests, in Hyginus:
quibus Achilles respondit se artem medicam non nosse. tunc Ulixes
ait: non te dixit Apollo, sed auctorem vulneris hastam nominat.
quam cum rasisent, remediatus est.</p>

The abobe fragments are taken from the
upper part of a roll 14 cm. high and
19 cm. broad. The writing tends to
assume a cursive form, and is stated to
belong to the second century A.D. The
first column was entirely occupied with
the chorus which is concluded in col.ii.</p>
<p>Col. i 2 παρέστα was restored by
Schubart. Wilamowtz at first read
Ὀρέστα, deducing therefrom an important
argument concerning the development of
the plot which he susequently abandoned.
See Introductory Note.</p>
<p>Col. ii 1. On the assumption that
some such word as αὔρα must have gone
before, Wilamowtz suggested νῦν γὰρ
στόλον ἀμὸν ἄελλα. He points out that
the genitive in - οιο was not previously
certified for Sophocles, although Φρυγίοιο
had been conjectured in Ai. 210. But it
is probable that Murray's correction δίνα
should be adopted: the same error was
detected by Hermann in Aesch. Pers.
579. The objection tha δίνα should
mean an eddying wind is not maintainable; 
for swift rather than circular motion
might have been expressed by it. Cf.

<p>6 Ἀτρειδᾶν scripsi: Ἀτρείδᾳ Wilamowitz</p>
<p>3 ff. If the restoration of Wilamowitz
is adopted, it is remarkable that, in a
passage where the functions of πρῳρεύς
and κυβερνήτης are so sharply distinguished,
Agamemnon should be identified with the
former and described as subject to the
orders of Telephus. Cf. Plut. Agis 1 οἱ
πρῳρεῖς τὰ ἔμπροσθεν προορώμενοι τῶν
κυβερνητῶν ἀφορῶσι πρὸς ἐκείνους καὶ τὸ
προστασσόμενον ὑπ᾿ ἐκείνων ποιοῦσιν. The
look-out man was specially charged to
watch for a change in the wind: Ar. Εq.
543 πρῳρατεῦσαι καὶ τοὺς ἀνέμους διαθρῆσαι.
Was it likely that Agamemnon would
undertake such a task? Nor do I think
that the text is justified by the metaphorical
use of πρῳράτης in fr. 524, 1, where
see n. I hesitate therefore to accept
Ἀτρείδᾳ in v. 6, and should prefer to
substitute Ἀτρειδᾶν. It is worth notice
that, although ’Arpeidcu etc. occur in
Sophocles more than 30 times, the
singular is only found in Ai. 1349.
For the metre, bacchiac dipody in place
of Reizianum, see e.g. Eur. Tro. 321.
I am also unable to agree with Wilamowitz
in joining εὐθὺς Ἰλίου, which he
compares with the isolated Eur. Hipp.
1157. It is simpler to give εὐθύς its usual
meaning, and to treat Ἰλίου as an objective
genitive: cf. Eur. Cycl. 108 πορθμὸν
οὐκ ᾔδεισθα πατρῴας χθονός; Ι. Τ. 1066
γῆς πατρῴασ νόστος. Hom. ε 344 νόστου |
γαίης Φαιήκων. So perhaps Ἰλίου στόλον
Eur. I. Α. 816 (England). There is
no difficulty in the combination of such
an objective genitive with the possessive:
see O.C. 729 Eur. Phoen. 934 (n.). For
ἰδέσθαι = to look out for, cf. Ai. 1165
σπεῦσον κοίλην κάπετόν τιν᾿ ἰδεῖν. Phil.
467 πλοῦν μὴ ᾿ξ ἀπόπτου μᾶλλον ἢ ᾿γγύθεν
σκοπεῖν. Eur. Κα. 901 Μοι ἀνάγκη
πλοῦν ὁρῶντας ἥσυχον. Plat. legg. 866 D
σκηνησάμενος ἐν θαλάττῃ τέγγων τοὺς
πόδας πλοῦν ἐπιφυλαττέτω.</p>
<p>7 Τεγεᾶτις. Sophocles also employed
the form Τεγεάς (fr. 1100).</p>
<p>9 σύν τινι δὴ θεῶν: cf. Aesch. Pers.
167 ὄλβον, ὃν Δαρεῖος ἦρεν οὐκ ἄνευ θεῶν
τινός. Eur. Phoen. 16 14 ὤστε) ἄνευ
θεῶν του ταῦτ᾿ ἐμηχανησάμην.</p>
<p>10 πεμπτήρ is a new word.</p>
<p>11 ποντίας...χθονός, his island home
of Ithaca. Wilamowitz points out that
this use of πόντιος does not occur in
Aesch. or Eur. and quotes Phil. 269 ποντίας
Χρύσης. Pind. Νem. 8. 18 ποντίᾳ
Κύπρῳ.</p>
<p>12 σύλλογος φίλων helps to identify
the play. Cf. Eur. Ι. Α. 1545 Ἀχαιῶν
σύλλογος στρατεύματος.</p>
<p>13 ἥσυχον...πόδα occurs also in Eur.
Bacch. 647 στῆσον πόδ᾿ ὀργῇ δ᾿ ὑπόθες
ἥσυχον πόδα, where however it has been
much suspected, and in Med. 217 οἳ δ᾿
μ’ ἡσύχου ποδὸς | δύσνοιαν ἐκτήσαντο καὶ
ῥᾳθυμίαν.</p>
<p>14 τοῖς ἐν τέλει is another slight indication
of Sophocles' authorship, since this
phrase occurs four times in the extant
plays, but nowhere in Euripides.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that the
Greeks did not sail by night, seeing that
the use of the stars for the purpose of
navigation was attributed to Palamedes

when wind οὐρίαν) and weather were
in his favour. Or it may be that the skill
of the nocturnal pilot, and not the danger
of his enterprise, was the chief motive of
the simile. See Zenob. 5. 32 οὐ νυκτιπλοεῖς:

<p>2 νέμ᾿ εἴ τις. The text of Pindar's
st is unfortunately corrupt, and the
value of his testimony has been variously
estimated. There is no doubt that some
of the uses of νέμω and its compounds
passed into current Att
wards became obsolete. The scholiast
that ἀπόνειμον in Pindar means
apparently on the ground that νέμω
ΙΙΙ p. 147 νέμει᾿ ἀναγινώσκει.
νέμεις· ἀναγινώσκεις. νέμω· ἀναγωώσκω)
and irarimii (cf. Epicharm. fr. 714 K.) are
used in the same sense by other poets.
In Theocritus l.c. the —῾το ᾿
to oneself (strictly, perhaps, ῾to con
or ῾spell ᾿)—is certain, and we may
believe that Parthenius (first century B.C.),
a learned poet, is following some such
authority. In Pindar most editors have
refused to follow the scholiast, but Bury is
inclined to adopt ἀνάνειμον with Tyrrell,
who suggests for our line ἀνάνειμον εἴ τις
οὐ πάρ᾿ δς ξυνώμοσεν. But they have
omitted to point out that the Greek for
recitare or recensere is ἀνανέμεσθαι: 11 Hdt.
I. 173 εἰρομένου δέ...τίς ἐστι, καταλέξει
ἑωυτὸν μητρόθεν καὶ τῆς μητρὸς ἀνανεμέεται
τὰς μητέρας. The schol. on Ar. Av. 1 389
held that ἀπενέμοντο glanced at the meaning
ἀνεγίνωσκον. To this should correspond
νέμεσθαι citare, answering to
νέμειν ῾to mark off, put down, ᾿
which we find in the phrase νέμειν προστάτην:
cf. Polyb. 6. 47. 8 τῶν ἀθλπτῶν
τοὺς μὴ νενεμημένους, ῾unlicensed ᾿
So κατανέμω in Aeschin. 1. 155 ῖνα ὐμεῖς
κατανείμητε εἰς τὴν προσήκουσαν τάξιν
Τίμαρχον, ib. 159. It is possible the
that we should read νεμῇ, and make the
sentence interrogative ῾won't you call
over...?'). But, on the whole, Bergk's
νέμ᾿ εἴ ni accounts better for the facts, and
particularly for the interpolation of ἀπόνειμον
(see cr. n.). We should render
ingly: ῾mark off on your list any
who are not ᾿ Madvig, who
interpreted it similarly
῾dinumerabis᾿). j., however, says of
νέμε, ῾it is simply “give ” i.e., “let us

ὁ ἐπὶ κώπης and proposed ἐξήρτυται
&#x003C; κώπαις &#x003E; to complete the
thought that the simple verb κεκώπευται
ought to be substituted, but the fondness
(??) for verbs compounded with
ἐκ and with slightly intensive force makes

<pb n="102"/>
the suggestion unnecessary: see on fr.
524. Meineke thought that κεκώπευται
στρατός was taken from a tragic poet,
and so Wecklein. The question remains
whether ἐκκεκώπευται meant ῾is
provided with οars,᾿ or ῾is equipped with
weapons.᾿ In favour of the latter, see
on Eur. Hel. 1128 μονόκωπος ἀνήρ and
cf. Timoth. Pers. 155 σιδαρόκωπος Ἑλλάν.
But of course the other meaning, which
Hesych. recognizes (II p. 460 κεκώπηται·
ἡ ναῦς), is perfectly legitimate, if required
by the context. See also Boeckh, Urkunden,
p. 291, who gives from an

120).</p>
<p>The inference to be drawn is that in
one of the passages cited ἐπιξενοῦσθαι was
equivalent to μαρτύρεσθαι, and in the
other to πορεύεσθαι. For the first (= to
demand good offices), which arises from the
host becoming bail (so to speak) for his
guest to his fellow-countrymen, cf.
Aesch. Ag. 1319 ἐπιξενοῦμαι ταῦτα δ᾿ ὡς
θανουμένη. ξεινοδόκος and ξεινοδοκεῖν are
said to have been used for μάρτυς and
ματυρεῖν by Simonides or Pindar: see
Apollon. lex. Horn. s.v. and Etym. M.
p. 610, 42. The other meaning is apparently
to be on one's travels, or to
sojourn abroad. It occurs in Isocr. ep.
6 τὸ μὴ πρέπειν ἐπιξενοῦσθαι τοῖς τηλικούτοις,
Arist. pol. 4 (7) 6. 1327a 13
Etym. Μ. p. 470, 47, and is based upon
the phrase ἐπὶ ξένης εἶναι, for which see

<p>ΑΧΙΛΛΕΩΣ ΕΡΑΣΤΑΙ</p>
<p>This was a satyr-play, as fr. 153 proves. It is probable
that the satyrs were themselves represented as unsuccessful
lovers of Achilles, and as filled with indignation in consequence.
Wilamowitz thinks that Achilles was the pattern of the
Athenian παῖς καλός, and that Phoenix (see fr. 153) was his
παιδαγωγός 1. Another character appearing was Peleus (fr. 150),
who may have warned Achilles that the sports of his boyhood
must soon be exchanged for the life of a warrior (fr. 156).
scr inferred that the scene of the play was laid in the home
of Peleus at Phthia, but the cave of Chiron on Mt Pelfon is
a much more likely haunt of satyrs, and is clearly indicated by
the language of fr. 154. It was moreover in the cave of Chiron
that Heracles met Achilles and fell a victim to his beauty. The
was related by Antistbenes in his well-known work entitled
m. 40 p. 264 West, Prod. in. Plat
AU I p. 98 Cr.), and was doubtless taken by him from older
Fast. 5. 381 ff. It may therefore be conjectured
with some confidence that the arrival of Heracles was an episode
iphocles. There is some authority for reckoning Chiron
himself as a lover of Achilles (Dio Chrys. 58. 4 11 p. 130 Arn.);
but that tradition is less likely to be early. The case of Patroclus
must be left doubtful. Aeschylus in the Myrmidons (TGF p. 44)
ed Achilles as the ἐραστής, and is followed by many
epist. 8, Martial 11 43. 10). But Plato
mp. 180 A rebukes Aeschylus as guilty of a perverse (??)
on the ground that Homer makes Patroclus the elder (Λ
and does not hesitate to call Patroclus the ἐραστής: so also
Aristarchus (p. 187 Lehrs). No inference should be drawn from
Phil 434.</p>

by Chiron. Wagner suggests that this may have been the motive οί the presence

gloss. The cod. Paris. (Gaisford's B) is

ἀνήμερον from Mosch. 1. 10. J.

provoked suspicion. Blaydes conjectured

Nauck's ἔχοιν δ’ ἄν, adoted by Meineke.

natural. — μὴ κακῶς go together, like μὴ

out that the indirect deliberative and

<p>Dindorf should not have combined this

find the story of the quarrel between
Peleus and Thetis vouched for by Sopho-

as it is said to have been described in the
epic Aegimius (fr. 1 K. : see Bethe in
Pauly-Wissowa I 963). The schol. on
Apoll. Rhod. u.s., giving the epic version,
says that Thetis used to test whether
’s children were immortal by plung-
ing them into a cauldron of water ; and
that this proved fatal several times. When
it was the turn of Achilles, Peleus stopped
her. So Lycophr. 178, who makes
Achilles the seventh child, ἀφ' ἐπτὰ
παίδων φεψ΄λῳ σποδουμένων Ι μοῦνον φλέγουσσαν
ἐξαλύξαντα σποδόν. Here it will
be observed that the child is burnt in the
fire, not thrown into the water ; and this
is the usual version. Other authorities
say nothing about the elder children :

with Thetis to afford good passage for
the Argo : she had given Thetis the best
of mortals for a husband, and held up the
wedding-torch with her own hand ; more-
over, it is fated that in the Elysian plain
Medea shall be wedded to Achilles, -who
is now being tended by Naiads in the

<p>Πηλιωτικόν. In fr. 1069 Achilles is
referred to as hunting on Mt Pelion, and
it is highly probable that the allusion is
to this play. It was in his cave on Mt
Pelion that Achilles was reared by Chiron
after he was abandoned by his mother
(fr. 151): see Eratosth. catast. 40. A
curious coincidence with the account in
Apollodorus (3. 171) may be noted: 6 δὲ
(scil. Χείρων) λαβὼν αὐτὸν ἔτρεφε σπλάγχνοις
λεόντων καὶ συῶν ἀγρίων καὶ ἄρκτων

the well-known description οἱ Pindar
(Nem. 3. 43 — 52) we find κάπρους τ᾿

was such that he slew stags ἄνευ κυνῶν.
Nauck thinks that Steph. Byz. p. 521, 10
λέγεται καὶ κτητικὸν Πηλιωτικόν refers to
this fragment. Cf. Stat. Achill. 2. 410. —

<p>Nauck says ‘versus corrupti medelam
’ But for the silence or hesitation
of previous editors, I should have thought
that the remedy was obvious. Campbell,
who half-heartedly suggests γλῶσσαν or
γλώσσῃ, thinks that the text may be
construed, ‘with honey from his ’
But γλώσσης depends on the verb, and
it is strange he should not have observed
that ῥεῖν and its compounds require the
dative (or less commonly the acc.) of the
flowing liquid: Eur. Tro. 16 φόνῳ
καταρρεῖ, Bacch. 142, Horn. X 149 etc.
The corruption of μελίσσῃ to μελίσσης is
hardly to be wondered at. The correction
occurred to me independently, before I
found that it had been made by Ellendt
and Blaydes. Wecklein also (Berlin,
philol. Woch. 1890 p. 656) proposed
γλῶσσαν μελίσσῃ, comparing Ai. 9 κάρα |

remark applies to Gomperz’s γλώσσης

was familiar: cf. μελίγηρυς, μελίγλωσσος.
In Homer of Nestor (A 248

Σοφοκλέους τοῦ μέλιτι τὸ στόμα κεχρισμένου

<p>ΔΑΙΔΑΛΟΣ</p>
<p>The plot of the play is entirely unknown except in so far as
a conjecture may be founded on the references to Talos 1: see
the nn. on frs. 160 and 161. I believe that fr. 162, which Nauck
hesitates to attribute to Sophocles, was also an allusion to the
brazen giant.</p>
<p>The only mythical incident connected with the name of
Talos is that which relates to the home-coming of the Argonauts
and is described in Apoll. Rhod. 4. 1638 — 1688: cf. Apollod.
Ι. 140 f. When Jason and his comrades desired to land in Crete,
they were prevented by Talos, the brazen warder, who according
to certain authorities had been given by Hephaestus to Minos,
and whose duty it was to make a circuit of the island three
times a day for the purpose of protecting it from strangers.
Talos pelted the ship with rocks, and the Argo was obliged to
sheer off. But Medea undertook to remove the obstacle, and,
after invoking the destructive Keres, swift hounds of Death, to
visit his eyes with destruction, made use of all her magical skill
against the enemy. The result was that Talos struck his ankle
against a pointed rock, and burst the σῦριγξ which contained his
supply of vital energy — ἐκ δέ οἱ ἰχὼρ | τηκομένῳ ἔκελος
ῥέεν (1679 f.). Fr. 1 61 suggests that this narrative may have
been the central incident of the Sophoclean play. Talos is
rationalized in [Plat.] Minos 320 C.</p>
<p>The evidence that Daedalus was a representative title of
Hephaestus is slight; but, though it is not universally admitted,
there are insufficient grounds for contesting the identification:
see C. Robert in Pauly-Wissowa IV 1995, Malten ib. vin 360
and Bury on Pind. Nem. 4. 59. In Eur. Her. 471, where
Kirchhoff, Dindorf, and Nauck retained Δαιδάλου, Wilamowitz
accepted Hermann's δαίδαλον. If we assume that Daedalus-
Hephaestus, as the artificer of Talos, was a prominent personage
in the play, there is the more reason for admitting the suitability
of a satyr-chorus in view of the cult-fellowship of Hephaestus
with Dionysus, and of his association with the donkey and the
phallus (Malten u.s. 356, Gruppe, pp. 245, 1306, 131 1).</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Robert merely says that the Daedalus ‘auf Kreta gespielt zu haben scheint ’
(Pauly-Wissowa IV 2006). Wagner suggested that the plot was similar to that of
’ Cretans.</note>

<p>ἴλλει. The question between the
forms ἴλλω and εἴλλω, for εἰλῶ (εἰλλῶ)
and the aspirated forms are to be rejected
for reasons given by Rutherford, New
Phrynichus, p. 89 f., is not easy to decide.
There is no epigraphic evidence, and that
of the MSS is worthless; for even the best
vacillate, and Jebb's inference (Ant., p.
251) in favour of ἴλλω is weakened by the
fact that R does not support ἴλλε in Ar.
Nub. 762. Cobet was emphatic in advocating
ἴλλω, brushing aside all the instances
of εἴλλω as mere blunders of the 
scribes: see Misc. Crit. p. 272,where he
sums up his earlier discussions. Rutherford
thought that the error τῖσαι (for
τεῖσαι) favoured the genuineness of εἴλλω.
Βut surely the converse error is equally
well established. Kuehner-Blass (II 413)
follow a good grammatical tradition
in distinguishing ἴλλω to wrap from
εἴλλω to drive: see Simplic. on Arist. de
caelo 231b 22 τὸ δὲ ἰλλομένην εἴτε διὰ τοῦ

δηλοῖ, ὡς καὶ Αἰσχύλος ἐν Βασσάπαις
(fr. 25). Unfortunately, this does
not help us here; for although the meaning
is clear—‘he confines him with fetters
no smith has forged’—, we cannot tell
whether the verb should be so written as 
to conform to the literal sense of πέδαις
or not. I write ἴλλει, but without much
confidence.—ἀχαλκεύτῳ πέδῃ. The same
oxymoron (ἀχαλκεύτοις πέδαις) is applied
by Aesch. Cho. 491 to the ἀμφίβληστρον
in which Agamemnon was ensnared by
Clytaemnestra, and by Eur. fr. 595 to the 
constraint imposed by αἰδώς.</p>
<p>R. Holland interpreted ἵλλειν οf forcing
an entrance into the island guarded by
Τalos. I should rather have guessed that
the line referred to the labyrinth, which
enclosed its prisoners with a new kind of
compulsion.</p>

<p>The context indicales that Pollux only
criticized the formation adopted by Sophocles

word often means very little (Rutherford,

chief of the builders of verse: Pind.

πυργώσας ῥήματα σεμνά, referring to

In Latin condere carmen and the like
were common; see Thesaurus IV 153.
The view of R. Holland that Daedatus
in these words was invoking the assistance
of the goddess in the building of his flyingmachine
seems improbable. Nauck unnecessarily 
suggests τεκτονουργός on the 
strength of Hesych. IV p. 138 τεκτονουργός·

<p>It is a legitimate inference from this
passage that Sophocles introduced Talos
as preventing intruders from entering
Crete by consuming them with fiery
heat, and also that the phrase σαρδάνιος
γέλως occurred in connexion with the
grimaces of the scorched victims. Being
constructed entirely of bronze he was
able to make himself red-hot in the fire,
so that he could destroy with his embrace
anyone who came near him. For the
isolated and obscure phrase σαρδάνιος (or
σαρδόνιος) γέλως, which occurs first in
Horn, υ 302 μείδησε δὲ θυμῷ | σαρδάνιον
μάλα Τοῖοι, two derivations were current
in antiquity. One of these referred it to
the island of Sardinia, where a plant was
said to grow so bitter that, when tasted, it
caused convulsive spasms and involuntary
laughter (cf. Pausan. 10. 17. 13, Tzetz.
Lycophr. 796, Serv. Verg. Ecl. 7. 41 etc.):
the other simply connected the adjective
with σεσηρέναι. The first derivation,
although it has influenced the spelling, is
clearly fictitious; but the second may
contain an element of truth (Adam on
Plat. l.c.), although Monro considered
that the phrase must be traced either to
a proper name, or to some foreign —
Egyptian or Phoenician — word, which
had become proverbial. It is further to
be noticed that the phrase is not always
employed in the same sense; for it is
applied not only to the sinister smile of
vindictive triumph (Hom., Plat.), but
also to the forced smile of the sufferer
(cf. Cic. Fatn. 7. 25. 1: the distinction
made in Tyrrell's note cannot be maintained).
It appears from the text that
the latter was the sense in Simonides ’
Sophocles. But the other evidence affecting
Simonides does not agree entirely
with the schol. Plat. Thus Phot. lex.
p. 500, 24 = Suid. s.v. σαρδάνιος γέλως . . . .
Σιμωνίδης δὲ τὸν Τάλων τὸν ἡφαιστότευκτον
Δαρδονίους οὐ βουλο9μένους περαιῶσαι πρὸς
Μίνωα εἰς πῦρ καθαλλόμενον, ὡς ἂν χαλκοῦν,
προστερνιζόμενον (l. προσστερνιζόμενον)
ἀναιρεῖν ἐπιχάσκοντας. The words
οὐ βουλομένους and the introduction of
Σαρδονίους are unintelligible. Bernhardy
(on Suid.), who records other conjectures,
suggests the omission of οὐ: I would
rather omit Σαρδονίους altogether as the
blundering addition of someone who
wanted to bring in Sardinia at all hazards,
as if ἐπιχάσκοντας were not enough, and
read τοὺς βουλομένους for οὐ βουλομένους.
The result would tally with the text, but
it is impossible to regard the account of
Zenob. 5. 85 as anything but a deliberate
attempt to conflate the two etymologies:
Σιμωνίδης δὲ φησὶ τὸν Τάλω πρὸ τῆς εἰς
Κρήτην ἀφίξεως οἰκῆσαι τὴν Σαρδὼ καὶ
πολλοὺς τῶν ἐν ταύτῃ διαφθεῖραι, οὓς
τελευτῶντας σεσηρέναι, καὶ ἐκ τούτου 6
Σαρδόνιος γέλως. The matter is of some
importance not only because Bergk rests
the version of Simonides upon the statements
of Phot. -Suid. and Zenob., and
neglects altogether the more trustworthy
evidence of the schol. Plat., but also as
affecting our estimate of the credit due to
these authorities, — and more particularly
to the source of Zenobius. Although
Sophocles is mentioned only by the schol.
Plat., the natural inference is that his account
of Talos was similar to that of
Simonides. It should be added that
Apollod. 1. 140 says of Talos, who is
introduced in the course of the story of
the Argonauts: ἳ δὲ ὑπὸ Ἡφαίστου Μίνωι
δοθῆναι, ὃς ἦν χαλκοῦς ἀνήρ.</p>
<p>It is worth while to notice that the
explanations already quoted by no means
exhaust the ingenuity devoted to the
elucidation of σαρδάνιος γέλως. Thus the
schol. on ν 302 also explains it by reference
to Talos, whom he describes as the
watchman made by Hephaestus and given
by Zeus to Europa to punish anyone
landing in Crete. πηδῶντα γὰρ els πῦρ
καὶ θερμαίνοντα τὸ στῆθος περιπτύσσεσθαι
αὐτούς· ὧν καιομένων, ἐκεῖνον σεσηρέναι.
As in the text of Homer, the
laughter is that of the avenger. Sardinia
was brought in by Timaeus (FHG 1 199),
who tells a strange story of the old men

<pb n="113"/>
being buried alive and laughing at their
prospective happiness; and by Demon
1 380), who speaks of the most
me captives and the old men over
70 being sacrificed to Cronos, and laugh-
ing at their own courage. Another fragf
Timaeus (schol. Lycophr. 796
FHG 1 199), describing the sacrifice of
the old men, makes their sacriticers laugh,
while they beat them with clubs and
thrust them over the precipice. [For the
reference of this story to ‘Aeschylus’ περὶ
παροιμιῶν in Zenob. 5. 85 see Crusius,
Anal. crit. paroem. p. 148.] Clitarchus
preferred the derivation from σεσηρέναι,
explaining that it was the custom of
the Carthaginians, when sacrificing their
children to Cronos, to place them in the
arms of a brazen idol, with a heati
burning beneath (schol. Plat. Plat., 1

The text as given in Wellauer's

shews differences of language, but not
much important divergence. Dinidorf
quotes the above extract from Brunck.
For ἐν Τάλῳ Brunck substituted ἐν Δαιδάλῳ,

cases where the name of a leading
character was substituted for the title of
the play: see fr. 125.</p>
<p>It has been suggested in the Introductory
Note that the story of the death
of Talos as told in the Argonautica may
have been a leading incident in the play.
Apollod. I 140 describes the σῦριγξ thus:
εἶχε δὲ φλέβα μίαν ἀπὸ αὐχένος κατατείνουσαν
ἄχρι σφυρῶν, κατὰ δὲ τὸ δέρμα τῆς
φλεβὸς ἡλος διήρειστο χαλκοῦς. He gives
three different versions of the death of
Talos, none of which agrees with that of
Apollonius: (1) he became mad through
the magic potions of Medea; (2) Medea
promised to make hmi immortal and drew
out the nail, so that all his vital fluid

of Aristophanes was a somewhat musty
one. If not, it is odd that the four illustrations 
quoted by the scholiast are all
of a comic character; that, if everyone
knew that there really was an Aetnaean
beetle, Plato the comic poet should have
thought it worth while to say that it
was reported to be bigger than a man
(fr. 37, I 610 Κ.); and also that the
Sicilian Epicharmus (fr. 76 ὁ Πυγμαρίων
λοχαγὸς ἐκ τῶν κανθάρων | τῶν μεζόνων οὕς
φαντι τὰς Αἴτναν ἔχειν) should mention a
report that there were big beetles on
Aetna. The remaining passage is Αesch.
fr. 233 Aἰτναῖός ἐστι κάνθαρος βίᾳ πόνων
(or πονῶν), from the satyric Σίσυφος
πετροκυλιστής. In any case, there is
nothing to justify Nauck in questioning
the authenticity of the fragment. On
the other hand, I see no reason to disbelieve 
the repeated statement (Hesych.
I p. 88 etc.) that the Aetnaean horses
were a big, as well as a good breed : see
also on fr. 672. The starting-point of
comparison was probably κάνθων: Greg.

<p>The adj. γοργός appears originally to
have meant ‘flashing’ (Eur. Ρhoen.

terrible (to look at)’ is easy: cf. Γοργώ,
γοργῶπις. Some modern scholars have
used this evidence in support of their
theory that the Gorgons were originally
sea-nymphs (Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 1864)
who dwelt on the shore of the western sea
(Roscher, Lex. ΙΙ 1694); but it is sufficient 
to say that the epithet is naturally
applied to the miraculous beings of sailor’s
stories. Gruppe (p. 12092) suggests a
comparison with the Haliae, who fought
with Dionysus against Ρ (Pausan. 2.

<p>On the question raised by this title and its relation to the
Arrisius see the Introductory Note to that play (p. 38). Of the
tents attributed to the Danae fr. 165 alone is significant,
and that, while agreeing well enough with Jacobs's assumption,
seems to be decisive against a solution which otherwise might
have deserved consideration, that the Danae was parallel in
construction to the Dictys of Euripides, and was concerned with
the events in Seriphos. For Wagner, who adopted the last-named
hypothesis, failed to show that the words of fr. 165 have any
appropriateness in the mouth of Polydectes, to whom he would
assign them.</p>

<p>The proper inference to be drawn from
the difficult text of Hesychius is that
Sophocles used the phrase ἀφροδισία
ἄγρα without clearly specifying in the
context to what class of animal it applied.
Some commentators held that partridges,
‘which of course (δή appears to be
ironically) are suitable for ’
must be meant, because their uxoriousness
is made a snare to entrap them. But
Diogenianus, if he was ’ original,
argued that the partridge must be
excluded, because, though a pig or a
sheep might be sacrificed for the purpose
of καθαρμός, a partridge could not. He
concludes that the pig (or possibly the
goat) is the animal intended. It is surely
implied in this statement that the context
in Sophocles was concerned with a sacrifice
of purification, although the words
relating to it are not quoted. The sexual
propensities of the partridge are mentioned
in Arist. hist. an. 1. 1. 13, 9. 9. 2
and in Ael. nat. an. 3. 5, 16; 4. 1; 7.
19. Cf. Plin. n. h. 10. 33. 100102.
The pig was the victim most commonly
selected in purificatory rites: cf. Aesch.

argument that the words γόνοιον μήλων
ought to be rejected altogether; and his
transposition of the words οἳ δὲ . . . ἁρμόζουσι

not yield a satisfactory sense. R. Ellis

<p>3 Blaydes's addition of the article is no

Add fr. 314, 359 παύου τὸ λεῖον φαλακρὸν

satisfactory to take πρὸς φαλακρόν as acc.
sing. masc. with διαγελῶν, although πρὸς
often follows verbs expressing emotion
(Τrach. 1211, Kaibel on El. p. 198).

λύσιν φυλάττειν. According to Reitzenstein,
the extract is ultimately derived
from Phrynichus (fr. 162 de B.).
Campbell joins ἄλυπον ἀνίας, leaving
ἄνθος isolated and in defiance of the order
of the words. He accounts for the latter
by strangely interpreting the grammarian
as imputing to the poet ‘an inebriate
looseness of expression,’ whereas he
actually says that ‘the style is abrupt,
though clear’: see e.g. Demetr. de eloc.
193 διὰ τοῦτο δὲ καὶ Μένανδρον ὑποκρίνονται
λελυένον ἐν τοῖς πλείστοις. The purpose
of the note is mainly to illustrate the
transferred sense of ἄλυπος, which a few
lines above had been glossed by ὁ μὴ
λυπούμενος. The words of Soph, are not
easy, and Nauck thinks ἄνθος corrupt,
proposing ἄκος, but the resulting sense
is weak. Tucker conjectured ἄλθος
( = φάρμακον), which is approved by</p>

<pb n="119"/>
<p>Mekler, and Weil droiat. I would render
’this sorrow-healing crown of ’ with
rmoron like ἐφίμερον κακόν (fr. 149)
or Juliet's ‘Parting in such sweet ’:
ἄνθος ἀνίας is thus exactly parallel to
μανίας ἄνθος in Trach. 999. (Valckenaer
and Blaydes introduce μανίας here for
ἀνίας.) One may suppose that the
did not appreciate the flavour of the wine,
t until they perceived its effect.
But, even apart from this, the potency
of the winecup may be described as
wounding: Pind. fr. 218 ἀέξονται φρένας
ἀμπελίνοις τόξοις δαμέντες. Or it affords
a mixture of joy and sorrow: Alcae fr. 47
1 μὲν μελιάδεος, ἄλλοτα δ᾿ | ὀξυτέρω
τριβόλων ἀρυτήμενοι. We have in fact
exactly the same oxymoron as here in
I tu lene tormentum
inferno admoves | plerumque duro, which
is adapted from Baechyl. fr. 16 J. γλυκεῖ’
ἀνάγκα σευομενᾶν κυλίκων θάλπησι θυμόν.
For the commonplace to which ἄλυπον
points see on fr. 758. There is not
necessarily any reference to the result of
excessive wine-drinking, as in Panyassis
fr. 1 4 K. πάσας δ᾿ ἐκ κραδίας ἀνίας ἀνδρῶν

<p>The Dolors were a Thessalian tribe, whom Peleus put
under the leadership of Phoenix: Hom. I 484 ναῖον δ᾿ ἐσχατιὴν
Φθίης. Δολόπεσσι ἀνάσσων. Pindar mentions him as the leader
of the Dolopians in war (fr. 184), although, as Strabo (431) points
out in quoting the passage, their presence at Troy is not
ited in the IIiad. Another link with the Achi
and in the fact that the inhabitants of Scyros were also
Dolopians (Thuc 1. 98, 2). So Tzetzes, Antehom. 175 ἐς Σκῦρον.
πων νῆσον, Λυκομήδεος ἄστυ. Building on this very slei
foundation, Welcker (p. 140 ff.) held that the Dolopes and the

<pb n="120"/>
Phoenix are alternative titles; that the subject of the play was
the fetching from Scyros by Phoenix of the young Neoptolemus,
against the wishes of Lycomedes and Deidamia; and that the
first εἰΚών of the younger Philostratus follows the Sophoclean
tradition. R. Wagner (Epit. Vat. p. 224) agreed with Welcker,
without giving any fresh reasons. Inasmuch, however, as there
is now good cause to believe that the mission of Odysseus and
Phoenix to Scyros was the subject of the Scyrians, Welcker's
guess concerning the character of the plot of the Dolopes has
no longer any probability. The Dolopians have no place in
heroic legends, except as explained above, and only two
possibilities seem to be open. Either Dolopes was, as Welcker
thought, a secondary title to the Phoenix, but with a plot relating
to the earlier adventures of that hero1; or, if an independent
play, it may have been concerned with the concealment of
Achilles in the palace of Lycomedes, and his discovery by the
Greek envoys. Fr. 174 is too insecure a prop to support the
latter alternative.</p>

<p>ΕΛΕΝΗΣ ΑΠΑΙΤΗΣΙΣ</p>
<p>The subject of this play is indicated by the title1, and was
derived from the narrative of the Cypria, as appears from the
epitome of Proclus (EGF p. 19): καὶ διαπρεσβεύονται πρὸς
τοὺς Τρῶασ τὴν ῾Ελένην καὶ τὰ κτήματα απαιτοῦντες· ὡς δὲ
οὐχ ὑπήκουσαν ἐκεῖνοι, ἐνταῦθα δὴ τειχομαχοῦσιν. According to
Proclus, the embassy was subsequent to the landing on the
coast of the Troad, and to the deaths of Protesilaus and Cycnus;
but Apollodorus (epit. 3. 28) and the scholiast on the IIiad
ntly to be quoted make it precede the departure from
dos. R. Wagner (Epit. Vat. p. 197) conjectured that the
hitter was an innovation upon the version of the Cypria made by
Sophocles himself. The embassy of Odysseus and Menelaus
has already been mentioned in the Introductory Note to the
AnUncridae p. 87). They were entertained by Antenor on
that occasion, as he himself explained to Helen (Hom. Γ 205 ff.):
ἤδη γὰρ καὶ δεῦρό ποτ᾿ ἤλυθε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, | σεῦ ἕνεκ᾿ ἀγγελίης,
ἰρηιφίλῳ Μενελάῳ· | τοὺς δ᾿ ἐγὼ ἐξείνισσα καὶ ἐν μεγάροισι
φίλησα. In spite of the support of Antenor, the mission was a
failure. Paris actually bribed Antimachus to recommend that
should be put to death; but from this danger
Antenor succeeded in rescuing them Λ 139 ff.): ὅς sc. Ἀντίμαχος)
ποτ᾿ ἐνὶ Τρώων ἀγορῇ Μενέλαον ἄνωγεν, | ἀγγελίην ἐλθόντα σὺν
ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι, | αὖθι κατακτεῖναι μηδ᾿ ἐξέμεν ἂψ ἐς Ἀχαιούς.
The occasion is identified by SchoL A on Hom. Γ 206: πρὸ τοῦ
τεῦσαι τοὺς Ἕλληνας εἰς Τροίαν ἦλθον πρέσβεις Ὀδυσσεὺς
ἀπαιτοῦντες Ἑλένην, ἐν οἷς (ᾦ conj. Nauck)
ἄλλων αὐτοὺς μεθ᾿ ὕβρεως διωξάντων μόνος Ἀντήνωρ ξενίζει
Φιλοφρόνως. ὅτε γὰρ ἐκ Τενέδου ἐπρεσβεύοντο οἱ περὶ Μενέλαον,
Αντήνωρ 6 Ἱκεταονος ὑπεδέξατο αὐτοὺς καὶ δολοφονεῖσθαι
Αοντας ἔσωσεν. The scholiast's words need not be taken to
refer ret assassination; they may simply point to the
ing an envoy. Such also appears to be the
tion of Ovid's at Paris et fratres et qui rapuere sub illo | vix
indas (Met. 13. 202 f.). According
(Antehom. 154 ff.), who includes Palamcdes,
and Diomedes in the number of the envoys, these
events occurred before the gathering at Aulis. In the rationa
h Herodotus received from the Egyptian pi
Menelaus and his colleagues arrived at Troy on their
with the same title was written by Timesitheus, who it only known from

<pb n="122"/>
mission, they received the answer that Helen was not there
(2. 1 18). For the poem of Bacchylides see p. 89.</p>
<p>Engelmann (Archäol. Stud., Berlin 1900, p. 16) found
representation of certain characters in this play on a vase
belonging to the Vatican Museum (Arm. 294), and identified
them as Helen and two of her attendants listening to an
interview between Odysseus and Antenor, which took place at
a temple close to the sea-shore. He concluded from fr. 177 that
the embassy arrived after Helen had reached Troy, and referred
fr. 176 to Helen or one of her women overhearing the Laconian
speech of Menelaus; Welcker1 had previously inferred from
frs. 176 and 178 that a meeting took place between Helen and
Menelaus; and that Helen, when her surrender was refused,
being now desirous of returning to Greece, contemplated suicide
as her last resource.</p>
<p>The connexion between fr. 180 and the events outlined above
is not at all obvious; and it does not seem possible that the
strife between Calchas and Mopsus, and the ’s death after
his defeat, were narrated in the play as having already occurred.
We must rather infer from ’s statements that the prediction
of his death was either mentioned by Calchas himself, or used
against him to counteract the effect of his own prophecies2.</p>
<p>The tradition ran that, after the capture of Troy, Calchas,
who had accurate foreknowledge of the disaster impending for
the Greek fleet, refused to return home, and, accompanied by
Amphilochus, the son of Amphiaraus, who was himself possessed
of prophetic powers (Cic. de div. 1. 88, Pausan. 1. 34. 3), after a
period of wandering, settled with his followers in Asia Minor.
The details of the contest with Mopsus are variously recorded,
but all accounts agree that Calchas died from chagrin at his
defeat. The preponderance of authority names as the place
where the two seers came into conflict the Ionian city of
Colophon, which contained the precinct and oracular shrine of
the Clarian Apollo: such was the version of the epic Nosti3, of
Hesiod (fr. 188), and of Pherecydes (FHG I. 94)4. A variant,
recorded by Servius on Verg. Ecl. 6. 72 on the authority of
Euphorion, the Alexandrian poet, locates the contest at the
shrine of the Grynean Apollo near Myrina in Aeolis. Herodotus,
however, in agreement with Sophocles, preserves the tradition of
<note type="footnote">1 In Nachtr. p. 293 he referred frs. 176 and 177 to the threatening speech of the
Achaean envoy.</note>

a settlement in Pamphylia (7. 91 : so Pausan. 7. 3. 7, Quint. 14.
Callinus (ap. Strabo 668) endeavoured to reconcile the
Conflicting statements by the supposition that Calchas died at
Claros, but that his followers in company with Mopsus crossed
the Taurus, and either remained ἰο Pamphylia or scattered in
other directions. It would seem that these are the aetiological
stories spread by rival sanctuaries, which attest the successive
immigrations of Greek settlers.</p>
<p>The Argument to the Ajax (p. 3, ed. Jebb) mentions a play
entitled Ἑλένης ἁρπαγή, as belonging, together with the
Αntenoridae, Aechmalotides, and Memnon, to the Tρωϊκὴ πραγματεία.
Οn the assumption that this play is meant, Nauck
suggested that it had been confused with the Ἑλένης ἁρπαγή of
Alexis, the poet of the Middle Comedy (II 320 K.). On the
other hand, Welcker (Ρ. 158 ff) had no hesitation in supposing
that the subject was the recovery of Helen by Menelaus from
the house οf Deiphobus during the sack of Troy1. Whether
‘ Helen’s rape ’ was a loose mode of referring to Ἑλένης ἀπαίτησις
is not easy to decide ; but, if a play so entitled had an independent
existence, I cannot belive that it dealt with any other
matter than the seizure of Helen by Paris2. Ahrens and Wagner
thought that the Ἑλένης ἁρπαγή described the conflict which
arose at Troy after the return of Paris from Sparta, when Antenor
and his party vainly advocated the surrender of Helen. But it
is improbable that Sophocles wrote a second play so similar
in its scope to the Ἑλένης ἀπαίτησις.</p>
<p>Ηermann's view (Comm. soc. phil. Lips. I 247) that this was a 
satyr-play proceeded on the assumption that Aristides, in the
passage quoted in the Introductory Note to the Ἑλένης γάμοι,
was referring to the Ἑλενης ἀπαίτησις.</p>

exercise of her magic power, and at the requeest of Thetis.</note>

αὐτός, Gomperz τραυλός, Mekler ἄφατος,
and Blaydes ἄλλος (with ὢν γλώσσης)
for αὐτός. The words are not altogether
clear, but are defensible, if ἐν γλώσσῃ is
taken after ὀσμᾶσθαι: ‘the very ring (of
his wordsO persuades me to scent a trace
of the Laconian speech in his talk.’ For
χαρακτήρ cf. Hdt. 1. 142 χαρακτῆρες
λλώσσης τέσσαρες, Ar. Pac. 220 ὁ γοῦν
χαρακτὴρ ἡμεδαπὸς τῶν ῥημάτων, and for

Lys. 619 καὶ μάλιστ᾿ ὀσφραίνομαι τῆς

word παρηγορεῖ was suggested by—and
intended to suggest—κατηγορεῖ, which
belongs to the vocabulary of teh Physiognomists:
see his n. on Aesch. Ag. 283.
He adds that in Hom. Γ 213 Antenor
describes Menelaus’ manner of speech on
this occasion: ἤτοι μὲν Μενέλαος ἐπιτροχάδην
ἀγόρευεν | παῦρα μὲν ἀλλὰ μάλα
λιγέως, ἐπεὶ οὐ πολύμυθος, | οὐδ᾿ ἀφαμαρτοεπής

words were like a shower of snow.</p>
<p>Tucker on Cho. 561 uses this passage 
in support of his view that differences of
dialect were actually reporduced on the
stage: see however, Archäologische Studien,
p. 17, infers that Helen or one of her
attendants hears Menelaus speak, and
recognized him as a Laconian from his
accent. See also Introductory Note.</p>

emended in various ways, but the true
reading appears to  be beyond recall.
(1) Hermann (praef. Eur. Hel. p. XIX):
χρῴζουσ᾿ ἕωλον γραφιδίοις ἐνημμένην,
muliere potiti, quae pingendo vexat marcidam
genam penicilis incensam, i.e.
rubentem ope penicillorum. But ἐνημμένην
in the sense of inflamed is very
harsh; the usual word would be ἐντετριμμένην.
Welcker, agreeing generally
preferred to keep γρ. ἐνημμένοις, and held
that ἕωλον must not be pressed too much.
Hartung extracts the same sense but
reads ἐγγράφοισιν αἵμασιν (‘mit angemaltem
Blut’), comparing Ant. 528
αἱματόεν ῥέθος. Ahrens, following Hermann's
explanation, thinks that the
couplet came from Antenor's speech:
‘shall we retain a woman like this?’
(2) Nauck conjectures τρωτοῦ Μενέλεω
γραβίοις ἐνημμένοις; Μενέλεων had previously
been suggested by Bergk, and
γραβίοις by J. G. Schneider. H. modified
this proposal by reading τρέστον rather
than τρωτοῦ (J. P. XXIII 272). For the
‘craven’ Menelaus see his note on Aesch.
Ag. 125. Blaydes's τὴν τοῦ Μενελέω γ᾿
ἀρτίως ἡρπασμένην is far from the original
and weak in sense. Helen is described
as threatening or attempting to burn. out
Menelaus’ eyes with a lighted torch: H.
compares Hygin. fab. 122 Electra uti
audivit id, truncum ardentem ex ara
sustulit, voluitque inscia sorori Iphigeniae
oculos eruere. Prop. 3. 8. 7 tu minitare
oculos subiecta exurere flamma! For the
word γράβιον see Athen. 699 E, where
Seleucus is quoted as giving the following
explanation: γράβιόν ἐστν τὸ πρίνινον ἢ
δρύινον ξύλον, ὃ περιεθλασμένον καὶ κατεσχισμένον
ἐξάπτεσθαι καὶ φαίνειν τοῖς
ὁδοιποροῦσιν. The phrase γραβίοις ἐνημμένοις
has high probability, but the
meaning given to the context is less
attractive. Helen with a lighted torch
recalls Verg. Aen. 6. 518 flammam media
ipsa tenebat | ingentem, et summa Danaos
ex arce vocabat; but it would not be easy
to work that idea into the traditional
text. (3) R. Ellis in C. R. IX 105
proposed ὀστοῦν θ᾿ ἕωλον γραφιδίοις ἐνειρμένοις,
as a description of a woman
picking her teeth with a stylus.</p>

by Suidas simply drew an inference from
the next of Aristophanes. The origin of
the story about Themistocles has now
been traced to the misinterpretation of a
statue in teh market-place of Magnesia:
see P. Gardner in Corolla Numismatica

<p>Nauck prints this fragment among
those of doubtful origin, although he
admits that it seems to belong to the
Ἑλένης ἀπαίτησις. But Dindorf is justified
in definitely assigning it to this play: the
evidence is quite as good as we have in
most cases, and the words are entirely
suitable to Helen's position. The play
Ἐλένης γάμοι is out of the question.
1 αῖμα ταύρειον. For the belief that
bull's blood was poisonous, and the
possible explanations of its origin see
Neil on Ar. l.c., Frazer's Pausanias, IV
p. 175, and Gruppe, p. 877u. According
to one version of the story, Aeson the
father of Jason was driven by Pelias to
suffer death in this way (Apollod. 1. 143,
Diod. 4. 50). H. Johnson in C. R. XXV
171 suggests that αἶμα ταύρου=menstrua,
on the stregth of ταῦρον· τὸ γυναικεῖον
αἰδοῖον Phot.</p>
<p>2 γε (see cr. n.) would be impossible
in this context, and although πλείω might 
be adverbial (J. quoted Plat. Phileb. 45 C
εἰ πλείω χαίρουσιν οἰ σφόδρα νοσοῦντες τῶν
ὑγιαινόντων, rep. 417 B πολὺ πλείω καὶ
μᾶλλον δεδιότες τοὺς ἔνδον ἤ τοὺς ἔξωθεν
πολεμίους), the combination of τι πλείω is
hardly to be tolerated. Blaydes recommends
καὶ μὴ ᾿τι πλείω...δυσφημίαν. Ι
prefer to read ἐπὶ πλεῖον in the sense of
any more, making τῶνδ᾿ masculine with
probable reference to the Trojans. O. C.
1777 μηδ᾿ ἐπὶ πλείω θρῆνον ἐγείρετε is now
explained as a case of tmesis: on doubt
rightly, unless there too we should read
πλεῖον. [This correction has been anticipated
by Wecklein, who suggested ᾿πὶ
πλεῖον τάσδ᾿ (or τήνδ᾿...δυσφημίαν), but
finally preferred ᾿πὶ πλείω χρόνον on the
ground that πλεῖον is not tragic (cf. fr. 774
and Aesch. Pers. 793). H., who had
arrived at the same conclusion, points out
that ἐπὶ πλέον is frequent in Thucydides,
e.g. 1. 65 ὅπως ἐπὶ πλέον ὀ σῖτος ἀντίσχῃ
‘may hold out longer’; so Hdt. 2. 171,
5. 21.] Cobet (Coll. Crit. p. 200) well
remarks: ῾δυσφημίς ἔχειν dicitur sensu
passivo, ut αἰτίαν ἔχειν, ὄνομα, ἔπαινον,
ψόγον ἔχειν, et similia his alia complura.
For the ambiguity of such expressions
contrast μέμψιν ἔχειν in Eur. Hclid. 974

τὸ ἀπειθεῖν καὶ ἀντιτείνειν. The evidence
of Photius and Suidas leads to the conclusion
that Sophocles used ἀναχαιτίζειν
in the sense of ἀπειθεῖν, and that there is
some confusion in the order of the words
as given by Hesychius. The words
κυρίως...ἵππων (cf. Dion. H. ant. Rom.
5. 15 οἱ ἵππι...ἐπὶ τοῖς ὀπισθίοις ἀνίστανται
ποσὶ καὶ τοὺς ἐπιβάτας ἀναχαιτίσαντες

the metaphorical sense of which there is
a good example in Plut. Demetur. 34
ὡς μὴ πάλιν ἀναχαιτίσαντια τὸν δῆμον
ἀσχολίας...παρασχεῖν. Cf. Ant. 291
κρυφῇ κάρα σείοντες, οὐδ᾿ ὑπὸ ζυγῷ | λόφον

and ἐγκόπτει no doubt refer to the
usage found in Lucian Lexiph. 15 ἀναχαιτίζοι
τοῦ δρόμου τὸ ῥόθιον, of checking the
way of a boat. In late Greek ἀναχαιτίζειν
is often the equivalent of refrenare (Phryn.

Καρίαν καὶ τὴν Τροίαν καὶ Λυδίαν Φρυγίαν.
καὶ τὸν θάντον δὲ τοῦ Κάλχαντος ἐνταῦθα
παραδιδόασιν ἄλλοι τε καὶ Σοφοκλῆς.
The various version of the story
relating to the death of CAlchas have
already been discussed in the Introductory
Note. We learn that the distinctive
point introduced by Sophocles was the
change of scene for the prophetic contest
from Claros to Cilicia. On the other 
hand, in schol. Dionys. Perieg. 850
(GGM 11 454) Mopsus leads the emigration
to Cilicia after the death of Calchas.
According to Hesiod (fr. 188 Rz.) Calchas
propounded to Mopsus for his solution
the question how many figs were growing
on a certain tree, and his calculation 
of the number proved to be absolutely
correct. Pherecydes (FHG 1 95) reported
the problem as oncerning the size of the 
litter of a pregnant sow. Other accounts
(see Strabo 643) mentioned both problems,
stating that Calchas propounded the latter
to Mopsus, and that it was answered
correctly; but that, when Mopsus submitted 
the former to him, Calchas failed
in his reply, and died of grief, as the 
oracle had foretold. Further variations
on the same theme will be found in 
schol. Lycophr. 427 and 980; but it is
impossible to trace the particular version
adopted by Sophocles. Pausanias (7. 3. 7)
states that the Pamphylians were of Greek
origin, being descended from the companions 
of Calchas who arrived there in 
that country after the fall of Troy. For
the geographical laxity, by which Pamphylia
and Cilicia are confused or identified,
we may perhaps compare Aesch.
Supp. 560 (530) καὶ δι᾿ ὀρῶν Κιλίκων
Παμφύλων τε διορνυμένα, with Tucker's
note. For the common identification of
the Trojans with the Phrygians see jebb
on Ai. 1054.</p>
<p>ΕΛΕΝΗΣ ΓΑΜΟΣ ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚΟΣ</p>
<p>The character of the play is clearly illustrated by Aristid.
11 p. 399 Dind., where he is speaking of hypocritical rhetoricians.
εἰ δέ τις αὐτῶν περὶ τῆς ἐγκρατείας διαλεγομένων ἀπαντικρὺ σταίη
ἔχων ἔωθρυπτα καὶ στρεπτούς, ἐκβάλλουσι τὴν γλῶτταν ὥσπερ ὁ

Lys. 155). αὐτὴν μὲν γὰρ ἐὰν ἴδωσι τὴν Ἑλένην,—Ἑλένην λέγω;

θεράπαιναν μὲν οὖν ὁποίαν ἐποίσηε Μένανδρος τὴν Φρυγίαν, τῷ
ὄντι παιδιὰν ἀποφαίνουσι τοὺς σατύρους τοῦ Σοφοκλέους.The
satyrs, then, were excited with passionate desire at the sight
of Helen's beauty.</p>
<p>According to the version of the Cypria (EGF p. 18), after
landing at Sidon (Hom. Z 290) and taking the city, Alexander
at length sailed to Troy, where he completed the celebration of
his nuptials1. But, as Welcker remarks, the scene of the satyrplay
was much less likely to be at Troy than before a shady cave
or near a babbling brook. I should conjecture, therefore, that
the action of the play took place at Cranae, of which HOmer
speaks as the first resting-place of the lovers:
<lg>
<l>ὅτε σε πρῶτον Αακεδαίμονος ἐξ ἐρατεινῆς</l>
<l>ἔπλεον ἁρπάξας ἐν ποντοπόροισι νέεσσιν,</l>
<l>νησῳ δ᾿ ἐν Κρανάῃ ἐμίγην φιλότητι καὶ εὐνῇ (Γ 443 ff.).</l>
</lg>
Pausan. 3. 22. 1 identifies Cranae with a small island off Gythium
in the Lacontian gulf; but Strabo 399 and Lycophr. 110 understand
Homer as speaking of Helena, the rocky island stretching
along the E. coast of Attica (Eur. Hel. 1673 n.).</p>
<p>Welcker suggests that the dance σκοπός (τῶν ἀποσκοπούντων
τι σχῆμα) was suitable to the occasion: see Aesch. frs. 79, 339.</p>
<p>181</p>
<lg>
<l>πέπων ἐρινὸς . . . . . ἀχρεῖος ὢν</l>
<l>ἐς βρῶσιν ἄλλους ἐξερινάζεις λόγῳ.</l>
</lg>
<p>181 Athen. 76 c, speaking of ἐρινὰ
σῦκα, figs of an inferior quality, says that
Sophocles in a metaphor applied ἐρινός,
properly the tree's name, to the fruit:
Σοφοκλῆς ὄ ἐν Ἑλένης γάμῳ τροπικῶς τῷ
τοῦ δένδρου ὀνόματι τὸν κατπὸν ἐκάλεσεν,
εἰπών· ‘πέπων . . . λόγῳ.’ πέπων δ᾿ ἐρινὸς
εἴρηκεν ἀντὶ τοῦ πέπον ἐρινόν. Alexis, he
goes on to say, speaks of the fig-sellers
putting τὰ σκληρὰ καὶ μοχθηρὰ τῶν σύκων
at the bottom of the basket, and ripe and
fine ones on the top, and so ἐρίν᾿ ἀπέδοτο,
σῦκα πωλεῖν ὀμνύων (fr. 128, 11 343 K.).
Eustath. Il. p. 1205, 3, quoting avowedly
from Athenacus, says: ὅτι ἐκεῖθεν καὶ
ῥῆμα ἐρινάζειν παρὰ Σοφοκλεῖ, ἔνθα τὸν
καρπὸν τῷ τοῦ δένδρον ἐκάλεσεν ὀνόματι,
εἰπών· ῾ πέπων . . . λόγῳ.᾿ παροιμιακὸν δὲ
αὐτὸ [qu. αὐτοῦ] τὸ νόημα, ὅμοιον τῷ
῾ ἀπαίδευτος ὥν πῶς ἃν ἐτέρους παιδεύσειας;᾿ 
῾ Being uninstructed, how can you instruct 
others?’ He took it therefore to
mean ‘Since you are yourself worthless,
thoe instructed by your conversation
turn out worthless too.’</p>
<p>The explanation of Eustathius is
accepted by Brunck, Schweighauser and
Ellendt; and Meineke's version (Theocr.2
p. VII) is practically to the same effect:
tu ignavae et inutilis caprifici instar aliis
ut item ignavos et inutiles se praestent
oratione persuades.’ He omitted ἄχρεῖος
ὤν ἐς βρῶσιν as an interpolation. On the 
other hand, Casaubon renders: ‘tu cum
sis grossus nihili et insipidus, ad come
dendum inutilis, alios verbis
increpas,
tanquam ignavos et insipidos’; and this
is also the view of Cobet (V. I., p. 289),
1 See n. on fr. 183.

<pb n="128"/>

who, deleting ἀχρεῖος, explains by the
paraphrase φαῦλος ὢς ἄλλους ἐκφαυλίζεις,
‘worthless yourself, you make out others
to be worthless, speak disparagingly of 
others.’</p>
<p>H., however, shows that the true
meaning has been perceived by Stephanus
alone of previous writers: ‘nam ὁ ἐρινός
quod ipse non habet, aliis tribuit,’ i.e.
fungeris vice cotis, exsors ipse secandi,
you fertilize others by precept like some
Nestor: see Isocrates ap. Plut. mor.
838 E. Similar is a proverbial line of an
old man marrying (Paroem. 1 p. 390)
γέρων ἐρινὸς εὐφρανεῖς τοὺς γείτονας, i.e.
αὐτὸς ἀχρεῖος ὤν, ἀλλους ὠφελήσεις. For
wild figs were proverbially useless (hence
Spohn restored ἐρινοί in Theocr. 15. 50
for the ἐριοί or ἐρειοί of the MSS). But,
though useless in themselves, they were
useful for impregnating the cultivated:
see the Dictt. s.vv. ἐρινάζω, φηληκόθ ρεπτος,
or Stein on Hdt. 1. 193. The proverb
ἀνερίναστος εἶ in Zenob. 2. 23 is differently
explained.
The reading in the first line is either
defective or interpolated. Porson, holding
the former view, conjectured πέπων
ἐρινὸς &#x003C;ὢν&#x003E; ἀχρεῖος &#x003C;αὐτὸς&#x003E; ὤν.
Casaubon's αὐτὸς ὢν ἀχρήιος is impossible.
Scaliger inserted παντελῶς after ἐρινὸς as
a stop-gar. On the other hand, Cobet
ejected ἀχρεῖος as a gloss, and Meineke,
as we have seen, suspected the whole
phrase ἀχρεῖος ὢν ἐς βρῶσιν. So far as
βρῶσις is open to suspicion in tragedy,
and ἐσ is quite normal.</p>

Lobeck (Path. El. 11 p. 114) hesitated

as Nauck says, νένομαι is an incredible
form. For the Ionic contraction of οη to
ω see Weir Smyth's Ionic Dialect, pp. 190,
267. In the verbs it is limited to βοάω
and νοέω. There is no other certain
example of this contraction in tragedy,
but Dindorf read κἀπιβῶ for κἀπιβόα in

<p>ΕΠΙΓΟΝΟΙ</p>
<p>ΕΡΙΦΥΛΗ</p>
<p>The Epigoni of Sophocles was one of his most famous plays;
and there is consequently a presumption that, when the title
1 lone is quoted without the name of an author, the play
of Sophocles and not that of Aeschylus is meant. The inference
be strengthened by the following considerations. It was
Customary in the fourth century, when the tragic art was
declining, and the age of the actors had succeeded to the
of the poets, to reproduce the plays of the famous dramatists
of the earlier period; but it is well known that the practice was
for the most part confined to the plays of Sophocles and
Euripides, whereas those of Aeschylus were considered too
old-fashioned and obscure for the purpose (Haigh, Tragic Drama,
p. 99). Hence, when we read of the actor Andronicus, with
whom Demosthenes studied elocution, having scored a success
in the Epigoni 1 Athen. 584 D), we are justified in concluding that
the line quoted from that play
<lg><l>ὀλόμενε παίδων, ποῖον εἴρηκας λόγον; (Tr. fr. adesp. 2)</l></lg>
belongs to Sophocles. We arrive at the same result from Cic. dt
rat. 18 idem Andriam et Synephebos nec minus Terentium
(??)ecilium quam Menandrum legunt, nec Andromacham aut
Antiopam aut Epigonos Latinos reicunt: immo Ennium et
um potius quam Euripidem et Sophoelent legunt.
know that the Andromache of Euripides was adapted
ntiope by Pacuvius, the inference is almost
igoni of Sophocles was adapted by Accius,
Similarly, when Cicero (Tusc. 2. 60) reports: Cleanthem (I 607
Arn., p. 328 P.) cum pede terram percussisset, versum ex Epig
nt dixisse, audisne haec, Amphiarae, sub terram abd
fr. adesp. 3), we understand at once that the referee
to the Epigoni of Sophocles1.</p>

<pb n="130"/>
<p>The direct evidence bearing on the plot οΙ the Epigoni, scanty
as it is, is sufficient to show that the central incident was the
murder ΟΙ Eriphyle, followed by the first beginnings of Alcmaeon’s
madness. All the authorities lay stress on the command given
to his sons by Amphiaraus, when forced by Eriphyle’s treachery
to join the expedition of the Seven, that when grown ι manhood
they should exact retribution from their mother: see Apollod.
3. 62, Diod. 4. 66, Hygin. fab. γ3. But Asclepiades1 (Schol. V
Horn. Χ 326, FHG III 305) reports this in the form that Alcmaeon
was forbidden to join the expedition of the Epigoni until he had
put his mother to death ; and Alcmaeon was said to have fulfilled
the behest. Apollodorus, on the other hand (3. 86), makes the
death of Eriphyle subsequent to the return of the Epigoni, stating
that Alcmaeon was moved by the discovery of his mother’s second
act of treachery in accepting the peplos from Thersander, the son
of Polynices, as a bribe for persuading her sons to join the
expedition, and was also instigated by the oracular command of
Apollo. From these facts Bethe inferred the existence of two
epic versions in the Epigoni and the Alcmaeonis ; in the former the
murder occurred after, and in the latter before the expedition
(T/ieb. Heldenlieder, pp. 129, 130 ff., 135 ff. : see also Gruppe,
P- 537)- Welcker (p. 2γ2) had no hesitation in holding that
in Sophocles the murder of Eriphyle preceded the expedition of
the Epigoni ; and treated the account of Apollodorus, which he
regarded as damaging to the character of Alcmaeon, as the
work of some later tragedian. This is as may be ; but it would
be idle to suppose that, if we see reason to place the expedition
before the matricide, we are thereby compelled to accept all the
details in Apollodorus. Indeed, his story (3. 81) is intrinsically
absurd and dramatically impossible. If Alcmaeon was already
convinced of the binding force of his father’s command, how could
he possibly postpone its execution to await the doubtful -·ι of
the siege ? ’ If I return safe, I will kill my mother ’ ! And was
Eriphyle so favourably placed as to be worth bribing ? What
inducements had she to offer which could have the slightest effect
upon a determined enemy ? Or, if she could persuade him to
spare her life — if only for a season — surely she needed no bribe
to make her undertake the task. The whole account is nonsense,
unless we suppose that Alcmaeon ό̓͂Α aware of his father s

difficulty that, if the Erinyes assailed Alcmaeon at once, he must
become incapable οf taking the supreme command. After
the death of Eriphyle his first object would have been to procure
expiation; and, if any weight may be given to the fragments
of Accius’ Epigoni, it appears that after the maricide Alcmaeon
sought to the offended powers by lustration and sacrifice:
see fr. IX upud abundantan antiquam amnem et rapidas undas
Inachi, x nunc pergam ut suppliciis placans caelitum aras expleam.
Since the Argives are described as eager for war (fr. III), it might
be thought that the siege and capture of Thebes took place
during the course of the play — a possibility not lightly to be
rejected, for which the Supplices Euripides provides an
adequate parallel. Nevertheless, Ahrens and Ribbeck (p. 496)
agree with Welcker as to the time of Eriphyle’s murder, and
the latter suggests that the Furies postponed the execution of
their vengeance until their victim should have finished his
appointed task. We do not elsewhere find them so obliging1.
Immisch (Jahrb. Philol. Suppl. XVII 180 ff.), who takes the
same view, is not justified in supporting it by postea as used by
Hygin.fab. 73 (Alcmaeon memor patris praecepti Eriphlen matrem
suam interfecit. quem postea furiae exagitarunt). Equally unconvincing 
is his suggestion that Alcmaeon was healed of his
madness by Apollo forthwith, but that it subsequently broke out
afresh.</p>
<p>It is highly probable that a dialogue between Alcmaeon and
Adrastus, the brother of Eriphyle, took place after the catastrophe,
and that the incipient signs of frenzy showed themselves at this
point. Since it has been shown that the Epigoni of Sophocles
was the best-known tragedy dealing with the story of Alcmaeon
and Eriphyle, a peculiar significance attaches to the inclusion οf
Alcmaeon by Antiphanes (fir. 191, 11 90 K.) in a list of famous
stage-characters :
<lg>
<l>ἂν πάλιν</l>
<l>εἴπῃ τες Ἀλκμένωα, καὶ τὰ παιδία</l>
<l>πάντ᾿ εὐθὺς εἴρηχ᾿ ὅτι μανεὶς ἀπέκτονε</l>
<l>τὴν μητέρ᾿ἀγανακτῶν δ᾿ Ἄδραστος εὐθέως</l>
<l>ἤξει πάλιν τ᾿ ἄπεισι.</l>
</lg>
Τhere is therefore good reason for following Ribbeck in
ning Τr. fr. adesp. 358 to this play: see p. 69.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 If it were legitimate to use Accius in reconstructing Sophocles—and in this
case Cicero's statement lends some justification to the attempt—there are several
fragments which might be significant, particularly those relating to the appearance
of Amphilochus 3. 15. 8, 9. 5. 15). By a brilliant conjecture in fr. XVI Bergk introduced
a reference to Glisas, the scene of decisive battle fought between the Epigoni and
the Thebans (Pausan. 9. 9. 4).</note>

<pb n="132"/>
<p>A difficult and important question remains: was Welcker
right in identifying the titles Epigoni and Eriphyle? Or, in
other words, is this a case where the name of a leading character
— for we cannot say that Eriphyle was more important than
Alcmaeon — has been substituted for the original title? A prima
facie case may be made in favour of separation: there are seven
unambiguous references to the Eriphyle; there is no evidence of
an alternative title; and the familiarity of the title Epigoni would
have been against its displacement. On the other hand, there is
much force in ’s contention that the tragic death of
Eriphyle must have been described in the tragedy which bears
her name, and there are several undisputed examples of a mistake
arising in the course of the tradition through the substitution for
the title of a name taken from the text1. On the general
question see Introduction, § 1; but this is not a case of
isolated error. Rather we should have to suppose that the
double title was introduced originally by the grammarians to
distinguish the play of Sophocles from the less familiar and
differently constructed work of Aeschylus; and that subsequently
the anthologists cited only one of the two titles2. Fr. 198 might
seem to be decisive in ’s favour, but, as it is not quoted
from the Eriphyle3, there is no reason why, if the occasion
required, it should not be transferred to the Epigoni. Therefore
we can only say that no other solution of the difficulty seems so
probable as Welcker's; and his identification has been accordingly
accepted in this edition. Jacobs preferred to suppose that the
Eriphyle related to the earlier expedition of the Seven, that it
comprised the quarrel of Amphiaraus and Adrastus and the
intervention of Polynices, and that the death of Amphiaraus
(cf. fr. 958) was described at the end of the play. This theory
cannot be disproved; but is it likely that such a play would have
been entitled Eriphylel?</p>
<p>There is an obscure reference to the play in Philodem.

was to compose the strife which had arisen between certain of the
characters, and probably, as Immisch has pointed out (Philol.
XLVIII 554), the reference is to the altercation between Alcmaeon
and Adrastus after the matricide.</p>

inversion of the historical development to

Campbell, who remarks that the
words are unmeaning in the absence of
their context, adds that the general sense
seems to be represented by ‘He who
acts honestly is better able to live down
’ This may well be the right
track; for envy is said to be powerless
against a good man: Eur. fr. 814 φθόνον
οὐ σέβω, | φθονεῖσθαι δὲ θέλοιμ’ ἂν ἐπ᾿
ἐσθλοῖς, Democrit. fr. 48 Diels μωμεομένων
φλαύρων ὁ ἀγαθὸς οὐ ποιεῖται λόγον. The
meaning of our passage will then be the
same as that of an anonymous writer
quoted by Stob. Jlor. 38. 39 φθόνος ὁ κατὰ
τῶν εὐδοκιμεόντων ἐπὶ τοῖς καλλίστοις
ἀργῶν Καὶ ἀπρακτῶν· τῶν δὲ ἀγαθῶν καὶ
οἵων τε τεκέεν τι παρ᾿ ἑωυτῶν χρηστὸν οὐχ
ἅπτεται. ’When men are attacked by
envy, disgrace is wont to prevail, if their
deeds are evil and not ’ tois
φθονουμένοις is thus the dative of the
person interested, and with νικᾶν used
absolutely does not differ essentially from
the dativus iudicantis (of mental interest
only) in Ar. Av. 445 πᾶσι νικᾶν τοῖς
κριταῖς | καὶ τοῖς θεαταῖς πᾶσιν. Tucker
wished to substitute νεικεῖν for vinav and
Wecklein δύσνοια for δύσκλεια, but in
either case the interpretation of the lines
is hardly less obscure, and in the former
there is the additional objection that
νεικεῖν does not occur in tragedy. Blaydes
proposed ἥκειν for νικᾶν. — For the omission
of the article with αἰσχροῖς, which
has the effect of emphasising kclXois by
way of contrast, cf. Eur. Phoen. 495 ἀλλὰ

<p>1 I think that Campbell was right in
preferring γυνή to γύναι (see cr. n.), but
I do not print a comma after πέρα as he
does. The nom. is used because the
words are an exclamation rather than an
address: cf. Horn. A 231 δημοβόρος
βασιλεύς, ἐπεὶ οὐτιδανοῖσιν ἀνάσσεις, and
see Monro Η. G.2 § 163. — καὶ πέρα is a
frigid hyperbole, but is perhaps excusable
on the ground that ὦ πᾶν σὺ τολμήσασα
is virtually identical with ὦ πάντολμος,
‘Ο thou who hast been wicked beyond
all ’ For the connotation of
πάντολμος, a very strong word, see
Headlam on Aesch. Ag. 228. There is
a similar but less patent hyperbole in Eur.
El. 1187 ἄλαστα μέλεα καὶ πέρα | παθοῦσα
σῶν τέκνων ὑπαί. So Jebb takes Ο. C.
1745 τοτὲ μὲν ἄπορα, τοτὲ δ᾿ ὕπερθεν. For
πᾶν τολυᾶν cf. fr. 567 n. The words
have not unnaturally been suspected:
(1) Meineke conjectured γυνῆς, treating
vv. 2 and 3 as a separate fragment;
(2) Nauck required something like w beivd
τολμήσασα καὶ δεινῶν πέρα (cf. Dem. 45.
73, Ar. Av. 416, Thesm. 705); (3) Stadtmueller
proposed πέρα λόγου. But the
text is probably sound.</p>
<p>3 εἴ τι κτἑ., ‘among all the sorrows

<pb n="135"/>
that are men's.’ πῆμα logically belongs
to the principal clause, but is attracted to 
the protasis. The common reading is 
more idiomatic and effective than Tucker's-
ἢ ’πὶ (HIII to HITI) πῆμα γίγνεται
βροτοῖς, which is an anticlimax. Blaydes
conjectured ἥτις. Cf. O. C. 1006 εἴ τις
γῆ θεοὺς ἐπίστατι | τιμαῖς σεβίζειν, ἤδε
τῷδ᾿ ὑπερφέρει. Τrach. 8 νυμφείων ὄκνον |
ἄλγιστον εἶχον, εἴ τις Αἰτωλἰς γυνή. Jebb's
objection to the superlative ignores the
development of the idiom, which has 
outstripped its logic. See also on fr. 87.</p>

see O.C. 378, 1387 with Jebb's n. on the

unsuitable to ἔτι, and I have very little

strangely enough disregards his ἐν οἴοιτς
which is its necessary complement; for
it is extremely unlikely that anthologist
Brunck, without remark, gave ἡ γλῶσσ’...

Bamberger conjectured γλῶσσ᾿ ἐν ἐνέοισιν. and
Papageorgius γλῶσσ᾿ ἤ ’ν ἐκείνοις (γλῶσσ᾿

<p>This is a difficult fragment and involves
the questions, (1) how the second word
is to be read, and (2) whether εὐφημίαν
is sound. (1) Brunck printed γήρως
προσόντος, but Dindorf reports him as
favouring προσήκων, which was adopted
by Hartung. But γήρᾳ προσήκων can
hardly mean ’having ’ or ‘approached
old ’ Bergk proposed general defence of old age. F. W.
προήκων. Recently ’s πρεπόντως
has won some acceptance, but, although
πρεπόντως and προσηκόντως were synonymoys
words, it is improbable that at any
period the former would have been explained
by the latter. The indications
are rather the other way: see Elym. Μ.

προσήκει. πρέπει. ’s παροικῶν has
no probability. For these reasons I prefer
’s προσῆκον as an ace. abs.: for
its use in tragedy cf. Eur. Suppl. 472.
(2) εὐφημίαν cannot mean ’silence’; the
last thing that was expected from the old
was to refrain from speech. If, on the
other hand, we translate ’good ’
there is not much point in urging an old
man to be careful of his reputation; and
there would be no inducement for the
anthologist to include the line under the
title ὅτι τὸ γῆρας ἀνεπαχθὲς καὶ πολλῆς
αἰδοῦς ἄξιον ἡ σύνεσις ἀπεργάξεται. We
expect something that is relevant to the
193 Stob. flor. 117. 3 (iv p. 1055
’s εὐβουλίαν and εὐρυθμίαν have
very little probability; and I think
’s εὐθυμίαν is far better, both for
palaeographical reasons and in point of
sense. Old age is not burdensome, if it
is borne with composure: cf. Plat. rep.

<p>The contract is between the permanence
of ἀρετή as a natural endowment, and
the instability of wealth. It is explicit
in Theogn. 317 τῆς ἀρετῆς τὸν πλοῦτον,
ἐπεὶ τὸ μὲν ἔμπεδον αἰεί, | Χρήματα δ᾿ 
ἀνθρώπων ἄλλοτε ἄλλος ἔχει. The possession
of ἀρετή is a gift of φύσις: see on 
fr 808 and the illustrations quoted by 
Headlam in J.P. XXIII 276, especially
Eur. El. 941 ἡ γὰρ φύσις βέβαιος, οὐ τὰ
χρήματα. Sophocles, one may think,
would have been on the side of Pindar
with his contempt for διδακταὶ ἀρεταί
(Οl. 9. 101) rather than on that of
Socrates: contrast Critias fr. 9 Diels ἐκ
μελετῆς πλείους ἢ φύσεως ἀγαθοί. In later
times the Stoies discussed the question
whether virtue once acquired could be
lost.—βέβαιαι. The only other instance
in tragedy of the fem. termination appears
to be Eur. El. 1263. Blaydes proposed
to substitute βέβαιοι.</p>

<p>A similar line is quoted from Menand.
monοst. 31 ἀνδρὸς πονηροῦ σπλάγχνον οὐ
μαλάσσεται, but the application is different.
The good man is unshaken in courage,
but the bad man is impervious to pity.
It should be remenbered that θυμός
comprehends both anger and courage
(cf. Plato's θυμοειδές), so that in common
speech the separating line was not clearly
drawn. For the softening of anger cf.
Eur. Alc. 771 ὁργὰς μαλάσσουσ’ ἀνδρός.
The present passage is more akin to Or.
1200 (referring to the cowardly Menelaus)
καί νιν δοκῶ...χρόνῳ μαλάξειν σπλάγχνον.
οὔτε γὰρ θρασὺς | οὔτ᾿ ἄλκιμος πέφυκε.
I cannot therefore agree with Nauck,
who would restore οὐκ ἀλλάσσεται affer
Nauber and F. W. Schmidt. If any
change were necessary, it would be better
to adopt Wecklein's suggestion that the 
line was interrogative; but the tradition
indicates that the subject was courage.
The figurative use of στέρνον, as applied
to the emotions, is peculiar to Sophocles:
see Trach. 482, O. C. 487.</p>

<lg>

<p>Hope is the common sustenance of
men (fr. 948), and their solace in time of
danger : Thuc. 5. 103 ἐλπὶς κινδύνῳ παρα.
μύθιον οὖσα is an exact parallel to v. 2.
So long as the issue is undecided. hope
may be cherished (Trach. ἔχει, | τὴν δ᾿ 
ἐλπίδ᾿ οὐ χρὴ τῆς τύχης κρίνειν πάρος);
but it is powerless against divine intervention:
Aesch. Suppl. 102 ἰάπτει δ᾿ (sc.
Ζεύς) ἐλπίδων ἀφ᾿ ὐψιπύργων πανώλεις
βροτούς. But the best illustration of the
text will be found in Dem. 18. 97 δεῖ δὲ

μένους ἐλπίδα, φέρερειν δ᾿ ὅν ὀ θεὸς

that these are the words of Alcmacon
surrendering comparing Accius fr. VI qui,

<pb n="138"/>
finetn miseriis, infers that in this play
Alcmaeon was acting according to the
direction of the oracle, and not merely
in execution of his ’s behest. The
sense is grievously marred by ’s
punctuation (adopted by Dindorf and
Campbell), who makes the question end
at τύχῃ, puts a comma after δεινόν, and a
full-stop after ὠφελεῖ. Hence, inasmuch
as v. 2 then becomes contrary to fact —
for hope is often serviceable in danger —
Bergk and Kock conjectured ὅπου τὸ
θεῖον, and F. W. Schmidt ὅπου τὸ δεινὸν
ἐνέπεσ᾿, οὐδὲν ὠφελεῖ. The reason for
this mistaken criticism is that ὠφελεῖν is
supposed to require a personal objec;
but Tucker has well shown (C. R. xviii
197) that this is not the case by quoting
Eur. fr. 274 τὸ γὰρ ἐπιεικὲς ὠφελεῖ τὰς
ξυμφοράς and fr. 714 πλοῦτος ὠφελεῖ
νόσον.</p>
<p>1 θείᾳ τύχῃ, ’heaven-sent ’
Sophocles is fond of this use of θεῖος,
which is illustrated on fr. 650. The
meaning of θεοῦ πληγή (fr. 961 n.) is
similar. For the general sense, the
necessity of submitting to the divine
ordinance, see on fr. 585.</p>

<p>The text is corrupt, but it is not easy
to decide between ’s ἄπελθ᾿·
ἐκείνης ὕπνος ἐατρὸς νόσου, and ’s
ἄπελθε· κινεῖς ὕπνον ἰατρὸν νόσου. The
latter quotes Eur. Bacch. 690 ἐξ ὕπνου
κινεῖν δέμας, and objects to ἐκείνης—on
the ground, I suppose, that to particularize
is beside the mark. For sleep as a

(Eur. Her.2 1 p. 138) plausibly infers that
the reference is to Alcmaeon asleep on
the stage, and that here, as in the Orestes
and Heracles of Euripides, sleep was
introduced as succeeding a fit of madness.</p>

shown by one of the derivations given to

to fill her with terror. Ribbeck, p. 494.

to stay his hand, declaring that she could
see an Argive army hurrying forward to
intervene in her favour; but this inter-
pretation is excluded by τῶν

<p>ΕΡΙΣ</p>
<p>The reading Ἰρις in Athen. 646 D, preferred by Casaubon,
Brunck, and Bocckh as the title of this play, is now exploded.
Welcker (Nacktr. p. 313), quoting Plat. rep. 379 E θεῶν ἔριν τε
καὶ κρίσιν διὰ Θέμιτός τε καὶ Διός, conjectured that the subject
he contention between Zeus and Poseidon for the hand of
Themis. Thi blunder is reproduced by Dindorf without
any intimation that Welcker had confuted Themis and Thetis:
cf. Pind. Isth. 8. 27 Ζεὺς ὅτ᾿ ἀμφὶ Θέτιος ἀγλα|ός τ᾿ ἔρισαν
ειοαν γαμῳ.</p>
<p>I would rather suppose that the Ἔρις wa a companionplay
to the Κρίσις, and that its subject was the strife
the three goddesses at the marriage of Peleus and
Thetis. See ’s abstrad of the Cypria (EGF p. 17):
ις εὐωχουμένων τῶν θεῶν ἐν τοῖς Πηλέως
στησιν Ἀθηνᾷ Ἥρᾳ καὶ Ἀφροδίτῃ,
αἳ πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον ἐν Ἴδῃ κατὰ Διὸς προσταγὴν ὑφ᾿ Ἑρμοῦ πρὸς
γονται κτἑ. The golden apple which Eris dro(??)

mentioned by a number of the later authoril (collected by
Pauly-Wissowa vi 465), and several hum- have
ed that it was an addition to the original story. Thoygh
omitted by Proclus, the apple appean in the very much
abbreviated account in Apollod. epit. 3. 2, and there is nothing to
(??)ld not have been mentioned in a sa(??)
It is obvious that the marriage of Peleus and
s was an occasion on which a chorus of satyrs might
well have been present, and
support the idea of a banquet. Two considerations which
in favour of this conjecture deserve to be stated (1) the
frequency with which ἔρις, especially in conjunction with κρίσις,
<note type="footnote">1 See Gruppe, p. 665.</note>

<pb n="140"/>
appears as a fixed term for the quarrel of the three goddesses, as
in the Argument to Colluthus, ἇρπαγὴ Ἑλένης: τὴν τῆς Ἔριδος
σύγχυσιν καὶ ἔριν περὶ τοὐ μήλου. Cf. Eur. Hec. 644 ἐκρίθη δ᾿ ἔρις
ἂν ἐν Ἰ|δᾳ κρίνει πρισσὰς μακάρων | παῖδας ἀνὴρ βούτας. Andr. 276
τρίπωλον ἄρμα δαιμόνων | ἄγων (sc. Hermes) τὸ καλλιζυγές, ἔριδι

γενομένης ἐν θεοῖς περὶ κάλλους ἔριδος, ἧς Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Πριάμου
κατέστη κριτής. There is very little doubt that to this list should
be added the passage of Plato quoted by Welcker, seeing that
Themis is mentioned in the abstract of Proclus as taking counsel
with Zeus: see ’s note. (2) If Ἔρις is to be taken as a
personification, the incident in question is much the most famous
affair in which she was engaged1.</p>

<p>The plot of this play proceeds on parallel lines to that of
’ Andromache. Our authorities for the contents are as
follows: Kustath. Od. p. 1479, 10 Σοφοκλῆς δέ, φασίν, ἐν Ἑρμιόνῃ
ἔστορεῖ ἐν Τροίᾳ ὄντος ἔτι Μενελάου ἐκδοθῆναι τὴν Ἑρμιόνην ὑπὸ
τῷ Ὀρέστῃ· εἶτα ὕστερον ἀφαιρεθεῖσαν αὐτοῦ
ἐκδοθῆναι τῷ Νεοπτολέμῳ κατὰ τὴν ἐν Τροίᾳ ὑπόσχεσιν· αὐτοῦ δὲ
Πυθοῖ ἀναιρεθέντος ὑπὸ Μαχαιρέως, ὅτε τον Ἀπόλλω τινύμενος
τοῦ πατρὸς ἐξεδίκει φόνον, ἀποκαταστῆναι αὖθις αὐτὴν τῷ Ὀρέστῃ·
ἐξ ὧν γενέσθαι τὸν Τισαμενὸν φερωνύμως οὔτω κληθέντα παρ
μένους τίσιν, ἐπεὶ ὁ πατὴρ Ὀρέστης ἐτίσατο τοὺς φονεῖς τοῦ
Αγαμέμνονος. The schol. on δ 4 is identical in substance, though
inguage is somewhat different, and the clause ὄτε...φόνον
ll that follows Τισαμενόν are omitted. But ὑπὸ Τυνδάρεω
is given in the MSS in place of ὑπὸ Μαχαιρέως, which is restored
ndorf. The only other allusion to Sophtt les in relation to
abject occurs ’ scboL Eur. Or, 1655 which, after some
ks concerning Euripides alone, proceeds as follows:
Φερεκύδης φησὶ (FHG 1 94) περὶ παίδων χρησμὸν αἰτοῦντα τὸν
Νεοπτόλεμον ἀναιρεθῆναι· ἐπεὶ Νεοπτόλεμος Ἑρμιόνην γαμεῖ τὴν
ιὶ ἔρχεται εἰς Δελφοὺς περὶ παίδων χρησόμενος· οὐ
καὶ ὁρῶν κατὰ τὸ χρηστήριον κρέα
διαρπάζοντας τοὺς Δελφούς, ἀφαιρεῖται τὰ κρέα αὖτούς, ἑαυτὸν δέ
ει μαχαίρᾳ. ὁ δὲ τούτων ἱερεὺς (αὐτὸν δὲ κτείνει Μαχαιρεὺς
ὁ τούτων ἱερεὺς καὶ conj. Leopardi) κατορύσσει αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τὸν
v τοῦ νεώ. ταῦτα γενεαλογεῖ καὶ
vhat meaning should be given to th
utterance in the last sentence; but I cannot agree with Wclckcr
that we are entitled to assume that Sophocles
followed unt of Pherecydes in-rcspect either (1) to the

<pb n="142"/>
motive of Neoptolemus in visiting Delphi1, or (2) to the origin
of the brawl with the priests. Welcker makes several other
assumptions which cannot be justified: that Orestes plotted
against the life of Neoptolemus, as in Euripides; that the scene
of the play was laid at Delphi; that Hermione was forcibly
carried off by Neoptolemus, and sighed for her former lover
Orestes, as in Ovid (Her. 8); that Pylades assisted Orestes in
attacking Neoptolemus; and that Neoptolemus in a dying speech
directed that Andromache should be sent to Helenus. There is
not a scrap of evidence to support these inferences; and it is far
better to adhere strictly to the statement of Eustathius, who
is our only explicit authority. A tragedy upon this subject was
also written by Philocles2, who is known to us from several
allusions in Aristophanes: see schol. on Eur. Andr. 32. The title
Hermione is also found among the works of Livius Andronicus
and Pacuvius; and several fragments of the ’s play are
preserved, and are used by Welcker for the purpose of reconstructing
the play of Sophocles3. The objections to this method
have been pointed out in several other cases.</p>
<p>The principal facts which emerge from the statement of
Eustathius are: (1) the betrothal of Hermione by Tyndareus,
during the absence of Menelaus at Troy. For this cf. Serv. on
Verg. Aen. 3. 328 hanc Hermionam quidam dicunt, cum Oresti
esset desponsata, post a Menelao apud Troiam admirante virt litem
Pyrrhi esse promissam: alii dicunt a Menelao quidem apud Ilium
Pyrrho desponsatam; sed a Tyndareo Oresti morante apud Troiam
Pyrrho, ut quidam promissam, ut quidam coniunctam tradunt.
Ov. Her. 8. 31 me tibi Tyndareus, vita gravis auctor et annis |
tradidit: arbitrium ueptis habebat avus; | at pater Aeacidae
promiserat inscius acti, etc. To the same effect Hygin. fab. 123.
(2) Neoptolemus was slain by Machaereus at Delphi. This is
related by several authorities, from whom we learn that
Machaereus was one of the priests of Apollo: cf. Strabo 421
Μαχαιρέως Δελφοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἀνελόντος αὐτόν, ὡς μὲν ὁ μῦθος, δίκας
αἰτοῦντα τὸν θεὸν τοῦ πατρῴου φόνου, ὡς δὲ τὸ εἰκός, ἐπιθέμενον
<note type="footnote">1 Ribbeck, öm. Trag. ρ. 262, agrees with Welcker, and actually attributes the
introduction of the words ravra (or ταὐτὰ) γενεαλογεῖ to the operation of this motive.
More to the point is his reference to Diog. L. 1. 119, where Pherecydes himself is
called γενεαλόγος. Wagner (Epit. Vat. p. 2762) was perhaps οἱ in referring the
words to the genealogy of Tisamenus, as related at the end of the play.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 See TGF p. 760, where it is hinted that the name of Philocles may have been

grandaevitasque Pelei penuriam | stirpis subauxit, as confirming the view of Welcker
that in Sophocles Neoptolemus went to Delphi to enquire how he might become a
father. It is manifest that the words quoted do not warrant the inference that has

πόλλωνος. Tryphiod. 642 ζαθέον δηλήμονα νηοῦ | Δελφὸς
ἀνὴρ ἐλάσας ἱερῇ κατέπεφνε μαχαίρῃ. It is important to observe
tht the schol. on Pind Nem. 7. 62, quotes ’
τραγῳδούμενα (FHG III 303) in support of his remark that
all the poets agree in naming Machaereus as responsible for the
death of Neoptolemus. Pindar, in his Paeam to the Delphians
(6. 118, Oxyrh. Pap. v 47), had given offence to the Aegin(??)
by the words ἀμφιπόλοις δὲ | μοιριᾶν περὶ τιμᾶν | δηριαζόμενον
κτάνεν | ἐν τεμένεῖ φίλῳ γᾶς | παρ᾿ ὀμφαλὸν εὐρύν, which seemed
to them to suggest that Neoptolemus was guilty of sacrilege.
The cause of the quarrel was clearly not so well-known as to
leave ’s expression free from doubt; and the newly
discovered scholia give various explanations: ἤτοι τῶν κρεῶν ἢ
διαρπαζόντων συνήθως τῶν ἄλλων ἐδυσχέρανε καὶ ἐκώλυε διὸ καὶ
ἀνῄρηται ἢ τῶν χρημάτων ἂ διαρπάζων εἰς ἐκδικίαν τοῦ πατρὸς
ἀνῃρέθη. In Nem. 7. 42 Pindar explains that he meant the first, —
ἴνα κρεῶν νιν ὕπερ μάχας | ἔλασεν ἀντιτυχόντ᾿ ἀνὴρ μαχαίρᾳ: but
(??)ccount of Eustathius, so far as it goes, suggests that in
Sophocles Neoptolemus was the aggressor. (3) The subsequent
birth of Tisamenus to Hermione and Orestes, and the derivation
of his name. It is impossible to feel sure that these
come from Sophocles: in any case, they can only have been
mentioned incidentally. For the fact cf. Pausan. 2. 18. 6.</p>
<p>Wagner (Epit. Vat. p. 274 ff.) throws doubt on the account of
r quite inadequate reasons, and prefers to follow the
s of Wclcker and Ribbcck to the plain statement of
only direct authority. He treats Sophocles as the source of
Apollod. epit. 6. 14, and would accordingly restore ὑπὸ Ὀρέστου
rather than ὑπὸ Μαχαιρέως for the corrupt ὑπὸ Τυνδάρεω in
schol. Horn. 84. Schwartz, on the Other hand, rightly consi(??)
that the fpitome is drawn in the main from Kuripides, but
contains a single motive taken from the Hermione of Sophocles.</p>
<p>Vater suggested that, if fr. 872 belongs to this play, the plot
may have been similar to the conclusion of ’ Orestes.
But, in view of the evidence already discussed, it is clear that
2 belongs elsewhere.</p>

retains κλαυστά in O.C. 1360. The question
of the origin of this intrusive σ was
discussed at length by Curtius, Greek
Verb, pp. 519 — 526, but his conclusions
are now out of date. The form in στος,
where not phonetically justified, must be
attributed to the working of analogy; γνωστός
is thus necessarily later than γνωτός,
although the contrary view was formerly
held (Blomfield on Aesch. Pers. 403).</p>
<p>ΕΥΜΗΛΟΣ</p>
<p>Eumelus, as Welcker remarks (p. 66), is not a tragic hero;
and nothing is known of any person bearing this name which
appears suitable for the subject of a tragedy1. Moreover, it
is only in Harpocration that the title appears; for in fr. 204
Εὐμήλῳ is an emendation for afirjXw. The best-known Eumelus
is the son of Admetus and Alcestis. who actually appears in the
Alcestis of Euripides. He commanded a contingent in the
Trojan war (B 711 ff.); was famous for his horses (ib. 763 ff.);
appeared as a competitor in the chariot race at the funeral
games of Patroclus Ψ 288 ff.), when he received something
in the nature of a ‘consolation’ prize; and won the
first prize at the games held for Achilles (Apollod. epit. 5. 5).
Later he was one of the heroes in the wooden horse (Quint.
12. 324). Hence Meineke, concluding that he probably survived
the war, referred fr. 911 to this play. ’s conjecture
Ἀμύκῳ for Εὐμήλῳ is improbable.</p>

<p>Εὐμήλῳ was restored by Musurus; and
the corruption of εν to a is frequent in
Hesychius, Blomfield conjectured Ἀμύκῳ.
and Blaydes approved. The gloss
has been further restored so as to read
αἵματος ἆσαι Ἄρηα...ὄθεν καὶ ἀσάμινθος,
ἐν ᾗ τὴν ἄσην...μινύθοντες ἐλούοντο.
For that is the form in which the lemma
and gloss occur in Suid. s.v., and Bekk.
anecd. p. 358, 31, with the addition of the
words ὄ ἐστι τὴν ῥυπαρίαν μειοῦντες after
ἐλούοντο. Suid. omits τὸ δόρυ after κορέσαι,
and neither has αὐτό after χρῶσαι, or
any trace of ἐνεορεῖ or of the reference to
Sophocles.</p>
<p>A few lines below Hesychius has αἱματῶσαι·
φονεῦσαι. ἢ φοινίξαι. Consequently,
M. Schmidt conjectured that
the words following μηνύθοντε belonged
properly to this gloss, and should be
emended to ἐναρεῖν Σ. Ε. This conjecture
is supported by fr. 987. On the other
hand, Schmidt is obliged to assume not
merely that the words in question have
been accidentally shifted, but also that
they have driven out the conclusion of the
clause ἐν ᾖ κτέ., leaving a gap It might
be possible to account for ἐνεορεῖ by reading
ἐμίνυθον οἱ ἀρχαῖοι, or even μινύθειν
τις ἀναιρεῖ. But, for reasons already
given, it can hardly be doubted that the
gloss of Hesychius has been mutilated,
and that it was originally identical with
that of Suidas. See also Suid. s.v. ἀσάμινθος.

Λεοντόφρων, ὃν ἄλλοι Δόρυκλόν φασι. Σοφοκλῆς δὲ ἐκ τῆς αὐτῆς
Εὐρύαλον ίστορεῖ, ὃν ἀπέκτεινε Τηλέμαχος. The story of Euryalus
is told by Parthenius, narrat. am. 3. After the slaying of the

<pb n="146"/>
suitors, Odysseus crossed over to Epirus on account of an
oracular command; and, while hospitably entertained by Tyrimmas,
became intimate with his daughter Euippe, and by her
the father of a son Euryalus. When the latter had arrived at
full age, his mother sent him to Ithaca, with certain tokens
proving his identity. Odysseus happened to be away from
home when he arrived; and Penelope, who had previously learnt
something of her husband's passion for Euippe, found an
opportunity to satisfy herself of the whole truth. Accordingly,
when Odysseus returned, without informing him of the real
position, she persuaded him that Euryalus was plotting against
his life, and should be put to death. Odysseus was thus induced
to slay his own child, not very long before he was himself killed
by Telegonus. It will be observed that Eustathius speaks of
Telemachus and not of Odysseus himself as the actual slayer.
In the concluding words of Parthenius Meineke found a
senarius τρωθεὶς ἀκάνθῃ τρυγόνος θαλασσίας, for which see
the Introductory Note to the Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀκανθοπλήξ. Wilamowitz,
Horn. Unters. p. 191, holds that Parthenius is an entirely
untrustworthy source for the reconstruction of Sophocles' play,
and that we must not accept his authority for the line
recovered by Meineke, or believe that Tyrimmas was the name
given by Sophocles to Euippe's father. But his scepticism has
not found favour with subsequent critics: see the authorities cited
by Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 62510. Gruppe himself holds that the
story belongs to a stratum of Thesprotian and Epirote legend
which was older than the Ionian epos. Recently, Vürtheim
(Mnem. XXIX 57) has given reasons for preferring the statement
of Parthenius that Odysseus rather than Telemachus was the
slayer of Euryalus: he urges that the homicide was used by
Sophocles as preparatory for the Νιptra, in order to vindicate
the poetic justice of the sequel, and that Penelope's vengeance
would have been incompletely executed unless the father had
been induced to become the slayer of his son.</p>
<p>ΕΥΡΥΠΥΛΟΣ</p>
<p>The story of Eurypylus, — of his alliance with the Trojans,
and his death in battle, — fell within the period covered by the
Little Iliad. He was the son and successor of the Mysian
Telephus, and his mother was Astyoche, the sister of Priam.
Homer λ 519 ff.) in referring to the exploits of Neoptolemus,
selects as the greatest of his achievements his victory over the
hero Eurypylus, the son of Telephus, who was slain, together
with many of his Cetean followers, ’ by reason of the gifts sent

<pb n="147"/>
to a woman.' The allusion implies a further knowledge of the
history of Eurypylus, and is variously elucidated in the scholia.
the present purpose it is sufficient to take account of the
explanation attributed to Acusilaus (FHG I 103). According
to this. Priam, hearing of the power of Eurypylus, sent a
message to him asking for his assistance. Eurypylus replied
that his mother would not permit him to render it; whereupon
Priam sent as a gift to Astyoche the golden vine which Zeus had
to Laomedon (or Tros1) as compensation for the seizure
of Ganymede, and which he himself had received as an heirloom.
That this version was ultimately derived from the Little
Iliad is made almost a certainty by the mention in one of the
fragments (fr. 6 K.) of the golden vine as the gift of Hephaestus
to Zeus, and as subsequently passing to Laomedon as the price
of Ganymede. Proclus2 merely states that Eurypylus came to
the assistance of the Trojans, and, after heroically serving their
was slain by Neoptolemus. Pausanias (3. 26. 9) gives the
Little Iliad (fr. 7 K.) as his authority for the statement that
(??)aon was one of the Greeks who were killed by Eurypylus.
Another notable victim who fell by his sword was Nireus
in. fab. 113, Quint. 6. 372).</p>
<p>The arrival of Eurypylus, his entertainment by the Trojans.
hire for the field of battle, and his immediate successes
are the principal subjects of the sixth book of Quintus; and
(??)nts are related in such a spirit as leaves upon the reader
the impression that the fame of Eurypylus as the last hope of a
cause (Soph. fr. 210, 76f.) must have been widely celebrated
rlier poets whose works are now lost. It should be added
Quintus, although he mentions Astyoche (6. 136) as s
of Priam and mother of Telephus, says nothing whatever about
the gift to her of the golden vine. On the other hand, it is
kable that Strabo (615f.) dismisses the story of Eurypylus
and his Ceteans, and the allusion in the words γυναίων εἴνεκα
δώρων, as riddles in the text of Homer the solution of which is
very. Nevertheless, he adds, the grammarians give
a supply of tales in their commentaries which are tedious rather
than convincing.</p>
<p>Among the writings which Quintus may have utilized was
the tragedy entitled Eurypylus, known until recently only I
ataloguc given by Aristotle (poct. 23. 1459b 6). of plays
<note type="footnote">1 In Hom. E 265 Tros is the father of Ganymede and receives the immortal hones

mentioned in this connexion by the author of the Little Iliad (supr.). The bribe of
the golden vine is in Serv. Verg. Acn. 1. 480 transferred to Tithonus, the father of
Memnon 2 EGF p. 37. Apollod. epit. 5. 11 adds nothing of importance.</note>

<pb n="148"/>
drawn from the Little Iliad, and classed by Nauck (p. 838)
among those of uncertain authorship. The fact that Aristotle
does not name the author is no reason for refusing to attribute
it to one of the great tragedians, since the Λάκαιναι of Sophocles
and the Ὅπλων κρίσις of Aeschylus appear in the same list;
Tyrwhitt, in his commentary on the poetics, inferred from Plut.
cohib. ir. 16 p. 463 D that the Eurypylus was written by Sophocles.
This conjecture has now been completely confirmed by the
papyrus fragments published as no. 1175 of the Oxyrhynchus
Papyri (IX 86 ff.). The circumstances of their discovery1, no
less than the internal evidence afforded by their contents, suffice
to show that a play whose subject-matter comprised the death
of Eurypylus was composed by Sophocles; and, if Eurypylus
was not the title, at least we know of no other which could be
so fitly applied to it.</p>
<p>The papyrus is terribly mutilated, and does not permit any
conclusion to be formed in regard to the development of the
plot. The only part which is continuously legible comprises
a dialogue between a woman lamenting the death of a Trojan
partisan and the chorus who sympathize with her. The former,
who reproaches herself as justly punished by the disaster, must
apparently be identified with Astyoche2. The dialogue is
succeeded by the concluding portion of a messenger's speech,
which detailed the scene enacted over the dead body of Eurypylus
after the Greeks had retired, and the despair of Priam at the
failure of his last hope. In the column which precedes the
dialogue above referred to, only the concluding letters of each
line are decipherable; but it is manifest that it originally contained
the earlier narrative of the messenger, describing the duel
between Neoptolemus and Eurypylus and its result. The fragment
ment preserved by Plutarch (fr. 768 N.2) which we have already
mentioned, portrayed the stern self-restraint of the two heroes
as they advanced to the conflict, and the words Χαλκέων ὅπλων,
with which that fragment ended, are still legible in the papyrus.
The identification, which was made by Wilamowitz, appears to
be certain; for, although the remnants are insufficient in themselves
to clinch the argument, the appearance of these particular
<note type="footnote">1 See the details given by the editor at pp. 30, 86, of their relation to the papyrus
containing the Ichneutae. It is worth remarking that Weil Weil (Reu. des Et. gr. III 343)
had drawn a correct inference from Plutarch's fragment: ‘ll résulte. . .que Sophocle
traita dans une de ses tragédies le sujet qu' Aristote designe du non d Ἐύρύπυλος
énumérant les drames tires de la Petite Iliade. La mere ’Eurypyle, Astyoche,
autre Eriphyle, était sans doute un des principaux personnages de cette tragedie.’</note>
<note type="footnote">2 The appearance of Astyoche at Troy is consistent with the legend that she and
her sisters together with others of the Trojan women were taken to Italy after the
sack of the city (Tzetz. Lycophr. 921).</note>

<pb n="149"/>
words at the very point where we should have expected to find
Plutarch's quotation, is a coincidence too remarkable to be
ignored.
The position of the remaining fragments is quite uncertain,
and none of them yields any consecutive sense without the
addition of hazardous restorations1. Α few conjectures concerning
their order and contents will be mentioned below, and
need not be repeated here. It should, however, be stated that
on the Tabula Iliaca, immediately before the representation of
the death of Eurypylus, there is an unidentified scene in which
two men stand before an altar; and it has been conjectured by
Wilamowitz2 that one of them is Eurypylus, who is promising
deliverance to the Trojans. Even if he is right, it does not
follow that a similar scene occurred in Sophocles, but it is highly
probable that the earlier part of the play was occupied with the
arrival of Eurgpylus and his welcome by Priam.
The younger Philostratus (imag. 11) describes a painting
which represented the duel of Eurypylus and Neoptolemus. The
greater part of his sketch is taken up with an elaborate account
of the shield of Neoptolemus, based upon the famous description
in the eighteenth Iliad; and there is scarcely anything which can
be supposed to illustrate Sophocles, unless it be the opening words
(??)ὐρυπύλου καὶ Νεοπτολέμου ποιητῶν ὑμνεῖ χορὸς
τε αὐτοὺς ἄμφω καὶ τὴν χεῖρα εὐδοκίμους κατ᾿ ἰσχὺν εἶν

the usage of epic poetry, preceded their
encounter. The reference to Scyros in
v 8 is thought to favour this view, but
might have been made by another speaker
as well as by Neoptolemus. On the
other hand, there are obvious difficulties
involved in the supposition that the two
heroes met on the stage, since it is abundantly

Accordingly, since τε is not an essential

I have placed ἄκομπ᾿ ἀλοιδόρητα
before δ]ιαβεβλημ[ένοι, understanding:
’whose enmity is declared without vaunt
or chiding.' διαβάλλω, which is very unsatisfactorily
treated in the lexicons, is
exactly our to set by the ears. The word
does not occur in Horn. Aesch. Pind. or
Bacchyl., and Herodotus is the first writer
ises it freely. In the following
instances, which are confined to the
passive, there is no question (I think)
thai διαβάλλεσθαι is simply invisum or
urn firei: Eur. Hec. 863, Hclid.
422 (n.), Hdt. Ι. 118, 5. 35, 07, 6. 64
Thuc. 8. 81, 83, The original meaning
must have been to be placed opposite to
(apart from), although our evidence only
to an opposition which has pasted
tility. The dative, of the person
ty has been con-
tracted, is usually expressed; but, if ἀλλήλοις
was absent from the present passage,
it was easily to be supplied from the
context. It is unfortunate that the idea
evil has become so closely
associated with διαβάλλω. It has nothing
whatever to do with the usage now
under discussion, but has led the critics
astray in several instances. Thus, in
1372 διαβληθῇς is perfectly
take care that you don't get into

should lose credit.' The case might be
strengthened from the orators,
but here it must suffice to quote one of the

Under κύκλος they explain k. χ. δ. as

intransitive use of ῥήγνυμι, although in
accordance with the general tendency
affecting verbs of motion (fr. 941, 11, fr.
973, Eur. Hel. 133511.), is not well attested,
and the best parallel is perhaps At. 775

Dobree was the first to explain. But it
seems doubtful whether ῥῆξαι it can
signify dash at: it should rather mean
burst into or rushed forth to, and neither
of these meanings will fit κύκλα χ. δ. On
the other hand, the circumstances seem
to shew that the vv. describe the opening
of the duel, and that κλυκλα ἄπλων cannot
mean 'groups of armed men.' κύκλα,
which occurs nowhere in tragedy, if not
here, is applied in Homer to a set of
wheels (Monro, Η.G. § 99*); and it is
unlikely that Sophocles would have
employed it in a nun-Homeric sense.

— Herwerden conjectured μεσομφάλοις

fregerunt hastas contra clypeos. Campbell
proposed κύκλωμα (adding συννόμῳ κερί
in the previous line) for ἐς κύκλα, thinking
that Eurypylus and Neoptolemus
met the reviling words of their enemies
with blows that crashed through their
shields.</p>
<p>H. points out that in the narrative of
Quintus neither Eurypylus nor Neoptolemus
refrain from arrogant boasting of
their own prowess. ‘In vi 384 after
killing Nireus he vaunts over him, τῷ δ’
ἄρ’ ἐπ’ Εὐρύπυλος μεγάλ᾿ εὔχετο δῃωθέντι·
“κεῖσό νυν, having met a better man."
Then he wounds Machaon, rants in the
same strain (413), καὶ εὐχόμενος μέγ᾿
ἀύτει· “ἆ δείλ᾿, . . . ὃς οὐτιδανός περ ἐὼν μέγ᾿
ἀμείνονι φωτὶ | ἄντα κίες” κτὲ., continues
triumphing when he is dead, and wounds
him again: in vii 479 he is repulsed by
Neoptolemus and others, but vaingloriously
threatens, 512 — 522 ὡς ἔφατ᾿ ἀκράαντον
ἱεὶς ἔπος, and these two then take
the lead in fighting against one another;
thus winning the congratulations of their
several sides, Neoptolemus as another
Achilles, Eurypylus as another Hector.

<p>46 δίκᾳ: see cr. n. Wilamowitz
assumed the existence of a present δικᾶν,
so that the meaning would be ’Fortune
judges thee not.’ But the antithesis so
presented is far from being clear, and it is
simpler to accept δίκᾳ. Hunt objects
that there is an inconsistency with 41
but, since δίκα is there ’punishment,’ the
inconsistency is at most a verbal one.
The rhetorical repetition of δαίμων is
Sophoclean: cf. fr. 753 (n.).</p>
<p>47 f. See cr. nn. The messenger's
reply shows that the purpose of Astyoche's
question was not to enquire whether the
Argives had departed. But the chief
reason for doubting the integrity of βεβᾶσι
is the difficulty of combining βίᾳ either
with it or with γέλωτ᾿ ἔχοντες. The latter
alternative would suggest ἀγέλαστα πρόσωπα
βιαζόμενοι sooner than ’laughing in
another's despite.’ On the other
ἐμβεβᾶσι. . .βίᾳ (‘have trampled violently’)
is peculiarly appropriate to the context.
Though a Greek might laugh at his
enemy's misfortunes (At. 79), he would
hesitate to spurn his corpse. Hence, in
answer to Agamemnon's οὐ γὰρ θανόντι
καὶ προσεμβῆναί δε χρὴ; Odysseus replies
μὴ χαῖρ᾿, Ἀτρείδη, κέρδεσιν τοῖς μὴ καλοῖς
(Ai. 1348 f.). The
κευμένῳ is copiously illustrated by Blaydes
on Ar. Νub. 550. For the simple verb
cf. Menand. mon. 356 μὴ ’μβαινε δυστυχοῦντι·
κοινὴ γὰρ τύΧη. Observe how
the position of ’Αργῖοι, recurring to the
verb, justifies that of βίᾳ. — The order of
the words is against the connexion οἱ αὐτόν
with τὸν νεκρόν, and it must therefore be
rejected. Mekler suggests ἀμόν, but I
prefer ἁδρόν, for which cf. Antiphan. fr.
144 (11 70 K.) ἁδρὸν γελάσαι ‘το laugh
’ It is unnecessary to alter τὸν
νεκρόν to τῷ νεκρῷ, for the accusative may
well be governed by γέλωτ᾿ ἔχειν after
the pattern of O.C. 223 δέος ἴσχετε μηδὲν
ὄσ᾿ αὐδῶ (Jebb's n.) or Eur. Or. 1069 ἔν
μομφὰν ἔχω. Observe that we must not
make νεκρόν the direct object of ἔχοντες
with γέλωτα as predicate: for (1) there is
no evidence that γέλωτ᾿ ἔχειν τινά could
be used for γέλωτα ποιεῖσθαί or τίθεσθαι)
τινα= ‘to make a mock of another';
(2) γέλωτ᾿ ἔχειν should follow the analogy
of αἰσχύνην ἔχειν, οἶκτον ἔχειν, ὀργὴν
ἔχειν, and many other Sophoclean examples
collected by Ellendt, s.u. ἔχω
p. 293 b, thus becoming merely substitute
γελᾶν.— For πρὸς τῷ κακῳ, insult
added to injury, cf. Eur. fr. 1063, 15 καὶ
πρὸς κακοῖσι τοῦτο δὴ μέγας γέλως.</p>
<p>49 ἐπεγχανεῖν. The simple verb (χανεῖν)
occurs in Ai. 1227, but ἐγχανεῖν is
exclusively comic = ‘to put out the tongue
at' (Starkie on Ar. Vesp. 343). Cf. fr. 3
344.</p>
<p>51 τυτθόν, not elsewhere in Sophocles

were those of Eurypylus and one of his
victims, perhaps Nireus or Machaon:
and that is the only inference open to us
in the circumstances. But in that case it
should be observed that ὁ  must be the
Greek, and ὁ δέ Eurypylus, although
Ηunt seems to be of the contrary opinion.
—For δόκος cf. Pind. Pyth. 2. 53 φυγεῖν
δάκος ἀδινὸν κακαγοριᾶν, but of course
there the metaphor may be taken from a
sting or a bite It is, however, a fair
inference from Aesch. Theb. 386 λόφοι δὲ
κώθων τ᾿ οὐ δάκνουσ᾿ ἄνευ δορός, and Cho.
842 τῷ πρόσθεν ἐλκαίνοντι καὶ δεδηγμένῳ
that δάκος could be used for a spearwound.
—The deictic use of τόσος (‘just a
few’) is recognized by the schol. on Trach.

adverbial as in El. 1009. Rossbach suggesis

<p>66 τοιαῦτα. Τhe purport of the preceding
words wa perhaps, ‘while Eurypylus
lived, our city was like a ship
securely moored; but now a fierce gale
has broken the cable.’ Cf. Tr. fr. adesp.
379,380.—λυγρόν. Hunt suggests πικρόν
as an alternative: he points out that οἰκτρόν
would be too long for the gap.</p>
<p>67 ff. It was usual to warp the corpse
of a chieftain in fine linen. Cf. Hom. Σ

β 97 Penelope is weaving a φᾶρος as
Λαέρτῃ ηρωι ταφήιον. Changes of clothing
were frequently provided, either at the
funeral or subsequently: Eur. or. 1436,
Rhes. 960, Thuc. 3. 58, Tac. ann. 3. 2.
For the use of linen see Studniczka,

fo introducing work from Istrian looms
into the Ilion of Priam, seeing that Istros

<p>the intention of substituting Σίνδων (Σίνδοι
was the name of a Pontic tribe) for
σινδών. But πολλή shows that σινδών is
right. — The text can hardly be defended as
it stands, although Hunt supports ἀνδρὸς
ἐρριπτάζετο in the sense of ‘ were cast
upon the man,’ and thinks that the grammatical
irregularity of διδόντες is parallel
to Ant. 259 f. and other similar examples.
But the genitive suggests an indignity, as
if the wrappings were hurled at Eurypylus,
and the harshness of this particular
anacoluthon is due to the fact that the
logical subject with which διδόντες ought
to agree is not expressed or even indicated
in the two preceding lines: contrast the
examples in Kuehner-Gerth § 493. Ant.
l.e., as a case of distributive apposition, is
much easier. Wilamowitz regards 69 as
an interpolation; but, as this οnlγ in part
removes the difficulty, I should prefer
to suppose that a line has been lost after
έρριπτάζετο such as γέρας θανόντος, οἶα
προιπτάζετο (Eur. Hel. 1262) Φρύγες.
This is better than to read διδόντος and
understand ἀνδρός of Priam, as I formerly
suggestd, although the apparent contrast
of γυναικῶν with ἀνδρός is somewhat
artificial. — The thought that the dead
receive no benefit from funeral offerings
is a commonplace. Cf. Aesch. fr.
266. Eur. Hel. 1421 τὰ τῶν θανόντων
οὐδέν, ἀλλ᾿ ἄλλως πόνος. Tro. 1248 δοκῶ
δὲ τοῖς θανοῦσι διαφέρειν βραχύ, | εἰ πλουσίων
τις τεύξεται κετρισμάτων. | fr. 640
ἀνθρώπων δὲ μαίνονται φρένες, | δαπάνας
ὅταν θανοῦσι πέμπωσιν κενάς. Verg. Aen.
6. 213 cineri ingrato suprema ferebant.</p>
<p>70 ff. ὃ δ᾿...Πρίαμος: Eur. Hel. 1025,
Phoen. 1128.—πλευραῖς καὶ σφαγαῖσι,
‘his wounded side,’ is a fair instance of
hendiadys, for which see Lobeck on Ai.
145. Cf. Aesch. Eum. 247 πρὸς αἶμα
καὶ σταλαγμὸν ἐκμαστεύομεν. For σφαγαί
in the concrete sense of ‘wounds,’ cf.
Rhes. 790 θερμὸς δὲ κρουνὸς δεσπότου παρὰ
σφαγαῖς | βάλλει με.—πατρῷα...ἔπη resembles
πατρῴωμ ὁρκίων in Trach. 1223.</p>
<p>73 would probably have been less
obscure, f we had recovered the earlier
part of the play. Since παῖδα, in contrast
with γέροντα and νεανίαν, must, as Hunt
had observed. mean ‘boy’ rather than
‘son,’ we may guess that Eurypylus was
represented as βούπαις, ἀντίπαις—like
Achilles in fr. 564—or ἀνδρόπαις—like
Troilus in fr. 619, and Parthenopaeus in
Aesch. Theb. 520. Thus, the meaning
would be: ‘one who, while a boy in years,
was both counsellor and warrior.’ Cf.
Eur. fr. 508, Paroem. 1 436. The topic
of the virtues characteristic of the various
ages has recently been handled by 
F. M. Cornford in Class. Q. VI 252 ff.,
and it is of course possible that παῖς
covers an allusion to σωφροσύνη. For
νεανίας=iunenis Wilamowitz quotes Hdt.
7. 99. Cf. fr. 314, 357 n.</p>
<p>75 ἐκκαλούμενος seems to mean ‘invoking,’
as contrasted with καλῶν in the
previous line. The meaning is the same
in Trach. 1206, where a subordinate in finitive
is added: οἷά μ᾿ ἐκκαλεῖ, πάτερ, |
φονέα γενέσθαι καὶ παλαμναῖον σέθεν.</p>

δωκας, which requires that the full stop
after σωτηρίαν should be removed and
that δ᾿ should be introduced after πολλῶν.
προύδωκας, ‘thou hast abandoned us’ (cf.
Eur. Hipp. 1454 etc.), would be good
enough; but the words ἔχων ἐλπίδων
σωτηρίαν are somewhat more suitable to
Priam than to Eurypylys, and the clause
χρόνον...μακρόν should certainly qualify
μνήμην παρέξετς, whereas in the revised
text it must be attached to προύδωκας...
σωτηρίν, with which it has no logical
connexion. For these reasons I retain
προύδωκά σ᾿, which has the support of the
papyrus, and, since Ant. 1166 would not
justify the rendering ‘I have lost you,’
Priam must be supposed to reproach himself
with having beteryed Eurypylus by
inviting him to Troy.—ἐλπίδων σωτηρίαν
is exactly like ἐλπίδων ἀρωγαί, which is
applied to Orestes in El. 858. Since τε
easily drops out—an error which may be
illustrated from the same passage—we
should probably read μεγίστην τ᾿ here.—

Teucer, who rather deserved his gratitude1?</p>
<p>The fragments of Accius are in themselves so inconclusive
that Ribbeck (Röm. frag. 419 ff.) is able to give them quite
ent application. According to him, Telamon in hi
out of Salamis, and was discovered by
r and Eurysaces living miserably in Aegina. By their
and that of the citizens he was restored to hi
<note type="footnote">1 Abrens, who accepts Welcker's view, thinks that the ἀπολογία of Teucer re(??)
may have been delivered on this occasion rather than at his

qui sit ignoratus, but admits that we cannot connect the statement with
fohcles.</note>

<pb n="166"/>
Ribbeck's reconstruction of Accius rests upon an extremely
fanciful and improbable interpretation of the famous passage in
Cic. pro Sest. 120 — 123. The difficulties involved are well-known,
and we do not possess the material necessary for their complete
solution; but Madvig's admirable note, reproduced in Halm's
edition (1845), shows the true way of escaping from the chief of
them, — the apparent inconsistency of the words in eadem fabula
(121) with the statement of the schol. Bob. that Aesopus imported
a reference to contemporary politics into his performance in the
Eurysaces of Accius. For it is certain that the quotations
o pater and haec omnia vidi inflammari belong to the Andromache
of Ennius. In view of the currency which Ribbeck's views have
obtained, the following remarks may be added: (1) It is a
desperate expedient to suggest that Aesopus interpolated into
the Eurysaces a canticum from the Adromache in order to do
honour to Cicero. (2) The reference to poetae in 123 and the
quotation from the Brutus show that Cicero intended to recall
more than one representation. (3) Since o pater in 12 is taken
from a lament for Eetion, who was killed, it is plain that patrem
pulsum in the following sentence applies only to the circumstances
of Cicero, and not to the fate of his prototype. There is no
ground therefore for inferring that the Eurysaces mentioned the
exile of α father, and the reference to Tusc. 3. 39, which concerns
the banishment of Telamon after the death of Phocus, is beside
the mark. (4) The two quotations in 122 must be assigned
to the Eurysaces, but there is nothing to prevent us from
supposing that Teucer was the exile there mentioned towards
whom the Greeks are charged with ingratitude. (5) There is no
serious objection to Madnig's conclusion that the quotations in
120 and the beginning of 121 are taken from the Andromache,
and refer to a Greek hero whose identity cannot be ascertained.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Serv. on Verg. Aen. 1. 619 points in another direction:
according to him, Teucer and Eurysaces returned from Troy
in different ships; and, as Teucer arrived first without Eurysaces,
Telamon, believing that his grandson was lost, refused to receive
Teucer.</p>
<p>It is at least in favour of Welcker's view that the events
which he introduces were subsequent to the withdrawal of
Teucer to Cyprus. It does not seem probable that in this play
Sophocles gave a different account of the home-coming of Teucer,
with or without Eurysaces, from that which he made famous in
the Teucer.</p>

Heracles was a very common character in satyr-plays,
is Welcker (p. 319) showed, although it is generally believed
Chat the Heracles of Euripides was the earliest treatment of his
a subject for the tragic stage1. It is quite possible,
are, that Sophocles wrote more than one satyr-play of
which heracles was the hero ; and, since the proper reference of
λεΐσκος is to the infant Heracles (see on Διονυσίσκος,

<p>Taenarum was situated at the southern point of the
promontory which lay to the west of the gulf of Laconia; and a
cavern close to the sea-shore was the legendary scene of the
final labour of Heracles, his descent into Hades to carry off
Cerberus from the under-world. This famous story was known
to Homer Θ λ 623), who, however, does not mention the
name Cerberus; but whether it was in the execution of this
task that Heracles is said to have fought with Hades at Pylos
(E 395) is by no means certain. Taenarum is mentioned as the
entrance to the under-world through which Heracles descended
by Eur. Her. 23 and Apollod. 2. 123. The incidents of the
adventure are most fully described by the latter (122 — 126), but
we have no means of connecting Sophocles with any of the
particulars. It should, however, be noticed that Heracles is said
to have returned by way of Troezen (Apollod. 126, Pausan.
2. 31. 2: cf. Eur. Her. 615) — probably in consequence of the
rescue of Theseus having been effected on the same occasion.
But the conditions of the satyr-play seem to require that the
successful issue of the labour should be declared by the
reappearance of Heracles with Cerberus1; and it is therefore
satisfactory to find evidence of a tradition which brought him
back to Taenarum (Pausan. 3. 25. 5).</p>
<p>From Eustath. Il. p. 297, 37 ἐν γοῦν τοῖς Ἡρῳδιανοῦ εἴρηται
ὅτι Εἴλωτες οἱ ἐπὶ Ταινάρῳ σάτυροι Nauck and Dindorf drew the
inference that the chorus in this play consisted of Helots. This
is an error, as has been pointed out by écharme2, Crusius3, and
Wecklein4: the intention of Herodian was to state that the
satyrs described themselves as Helots, and served in that
capacity, just as in the Cyclops they were δοῦλοι of Polyphemus,
and in other plays appeared as smiths (Σφυροκόποι),
(Θερισταί), and acolytes (Κήρυκες). See also p. 71.</p>
<p>Nauck refers to the opinion of W. Hippenstiel (de Gr. trag.
princ. fab. nom. diss. Marpurg. 1887, p. 17) that the play was
produced in the last few years of Sophocles' life, but does not
explain his reasons.</p>

Phil. 1421, El. 1 173, Eur. Alc. 419, 782
Andr. 1271 f., Or. 1245, Lys. 25. 11. In
other words, ὀφείλεται does not seem to
have become impersonal, like πρέπει,
προσήκει, and the rest. For the shifting
usage of these verbs see Kuehner-Gerth
II 27, and it is of course arguable that
ἀφείλεται here may have suffered extension
after their analogy.</p>

<p>Wagner and M. Schmidt suggested that
the error of Photius might be explained

been &#x003C;οὐ κωφεῖ:&#x003E; οὐ κωφίζει· οὐ βλάπτει.</p>

probably ’blunt, ’ as in Hom. A 390

‘dumb’ was a special application, but
the ancient grammarians, and even Porson
on Eur. Or. 1279, reversed the history of
the word. For the wider meaning of the

<p>HPITONH</p>
<p>Besides that of Sophocles, we have a record of plays
composed with this title by Phrynichus1, Philocles, and Cleophon.
ius also wrote an Erigona, as we shall see. There is nothing
in the three references to it in his brother's correspondence to
v the character of the Erigona composed or translated by
Q. Cicero (Cic. Q.fr. 3. 1,6, 9).</p>
<p>Wclcker (p. 215) identified this play with the Aletes2 (see
p. 62), on the ground that, inasmuch as Aletes and Erigone
were brother and sister, the son and daughter of Aegisthus and
taemnestra, and Orestes was the opponent of both, a divided
action is not to be thought of. There is nothing in the fragments
ribed to cither title which assists or hinders the identification;
but, though Welcker is probably right in his view of the Alet
it by no means follows that the Erigone refers to the same series
of events.</p>
<p>The name of Krigone was familiar to the Athenians in
connexion with the curious festival known as aiatpa (for which
the commentators on Verg. Georg. 2. 389), at which was sung
tin song known as αλῆτις. Several aetiological legends arose
to account for the obsolete and unintelligible titles, of which
eed only refer to two.</p>
<p>(I) In the first of these Krigone it still the daughter of
gisthus, but she is brought to Athens as the accuser of
before the Areopagus. The most explicit account is preserved
in Etym. M. p. 42, 3 λέγεται γὰρ Ἡριγόνην τὴν Αίγίσθου
νταιμνήστρας θυγατέρα, σὺν Τυνδάρεῳ τῷ πάππῳ ἐλθεῖν
Αθήναζε, κατηγορήσουσαν Ορέστου· ἀπολυθέντα (? ος) δέ,
αρτήσασαν ἐαυτὴν προστρόπαιον τοῖς Αθηναίοις γενέσθαι.
α χρησμὸν δὲ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ συντελεῖσθαι τὴν ἑορτήν. Το the same
Marm. Par FHG 1 546, where Orstes is said to have
been tried for the death of Aegisthus, and this no doubt accounts
the appearance of Erigone, his nearest surviving relative,
accuser. Cf. Dictys bell. Troi. 6. 4. In Apollod. epit. 6. 25
said, according to different accounts, to have been
ither by the Erinyes or by Tyndarcus or
by is doubtless doubtless of these
passages as claiming retribution for the death of his dauthter

Clytaemnestra1. According to others, Orestes married Erigone
(Tzetz. Lycophr. 1374), and Cinaethon (fr. 4, EGF p. 197)
mentioned Penthilus, their son.</p>
<p>(2) Another legend made Erigone the daughter of Icarius,
by whom Dionysus was hospitably entertained, and to whom he
gave a wine-skin, with instructions to spread abroad the
knowledge of the newly bestowed blessing. Icarius, with his
daughter Erigone and his dog Maera, came to Attica in the
course of his mission, and freely bestowed his wine upon the
rustics. The intoxicating results which followed convinced the
shepherds that they had been poisoned, and they straightway
cudgelled Icarius to death. The dog Maera by her howls guided
Erigone to her ’s unburied body; and Erigone, distraught
with sorrow, hanged herself on a neighbouring tree. The
punishment of heaven fell upon the guilty Athenians, who at
length appeased the divine resentment by the institution of a
festival (αἰώρα, oscilla) in honour of Erigone. See
fab. 130, Ov. Ibis 611 ff., Aelian nat. an. 7. 28, Nonn. Dionys.
47. 34 — 264. The literary sources of this story have not been
traced to any earlier writer than Eratosthenes, who wrote an
elegy entitled Erigone (E. Maass, Anal. Eratosth. p. 132).
Ribbeck (Röm. Trag. p. 621) develops the view that the
of Sophocles was the daughter of Icarius, correcting ἐν σμηριγόνη
or σμυριγόνη the reading of the MSS in Erotian (fr. 236) to
ἐν σατυρικῇ Ἡριγόνῃ. He points out that the reception of
Dionysus with his chorus of satyrs by the Attic peasants offered
suitable opportunities for comic episodes.</p>
<p>On the whole, though the evidence is insufficient to determine
the contents of the Erigone, the balance of probability is against
Welcker's identification. Against Ribbeck's view must be set
the fact that the fragments of ’ play undoubtedly relate to
the story of Orestes, and he himself inclines to the identification
of the Erigona with the Agamemnonidae. The frequent
occurrence of the title suggests that it was suitable to a tragedy
rather than to a satyr-play. Maass (op. cit. p. 133 115) adds that
before Ribbeck's conjecture is approved we must satisfy ourselves
that the Icarian Erigone was known as early as Sophocles2.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Wagner suggested that Tyndareus appeared in the character of the legal representative
of Erigone, who could not have conducted the accusation in person owing to
her juristic incapacity. On the other hand, if Aletes was adult, there was no reason
for the introduction of Tyndareus into the Aletes, and consequently fr. 646 belonged
rather to the Erigone.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 The same remark applies to Haigh's classification of the plays of Phrynichus,
Philocles, and Cleophon (p. 477 ff.).</note>

περὶ αὐτὸ θαλάμας.’ The evidence of the
MSS of Hippocrates, of the lexicographers,
and of Euripides and his scholia is so
strong in favour of the form ὕπαφρος that
we can only consider ὕποφρος to be an 
error in all three places of Erotian. The
next question concerns the meaning of 
the word which was obsolete and unfamiliar
in Alexandrian times. It may
be remarked that the authority of Erotian
stands high in itself, and is here supported
by the express testimony of Heracleides:
we conclude that the interpretation
κρνφαῖον rests on teh sound tradition of
scholarly writers. As Sophocles is quoted
for this meaning, some strong reason is 
required to justify any other interpretation.
But the other evidence confirms
Erotian: Phot. lex. p. 620, 19 and
Hesych. IV p. 200 explain by ὔπουλον,
κρύφιον and μὴ φανερόν (μή om. Phot.);
and the schol. on Eur. Rhes. 711 has
ὔπαφρος ὀ μὴ φανερός, ἐκ μεταφορᾶς τῶν
ὐπ᾿ ἀφρὸν νηχομένων, ἤ τῶν ὐφάλων
πετρῶν, αἴς ἐπανθεῖ ἀφρός· ἤ ὀ καταπληκτικός,
ὁ μανικός, The passage in Eur.
l.c. describes the entrance of Odysseus
into Troy disguised as a beggar: ἔβα καὶ
πάρος | κατὰ πόλιν ὔπαφρον ὄμμ᾿ ἔχων |
ῥακοδύτῳ στολᾷ κτέ. The following
explannations have been given: (1) with
the face of an idiot, (2) blear-eyed,
rheumy, (3) tear-stained, (4) treacherous
(or disguised?). The first three assume
that the origin of the word is to be traced
either to ἄφρων or to ἀφρός, and the only
ancient evidence in their favour, apart
from the scholium, is an alternative gloss
in Hesychius: ὐγρασίαν ἔχον ἐμφερῆ
ἀφρῷ. The balance is strongly on the
side of teh rendering κρυφαῖος, and there
is nothing against it except that we do
not know the history of teh word.
Whether it has anything to do with
ἀφρός, meaning, as J. suggests, ‘having
foam beneath’ (cf. ὕπουλος), must remain
uncertain. The restorations proposed,
νῦν δῆρις ἦν (Herwerden), νῦν δ᾿ εἰρφ᾿
Ἄρης ὔπαφρος, ‘fermenting secretly’; but
what is to be made of ἐξ αὐτῶν? Perhapes
νῦν δ᾿ εἶρπε φρὴν ὔπαφρος ἐξ αὐτῶν, i.e.
insensibly their consciousness left them.
The scribe's eye passed from one ρ to
the other, and the loss of ν was due to its
being writtem above the line (Cobet, Var.
Lect. p. 530). R. Ellis (C. R. IX 105)
thought that ὔποφρος was a mistake for
ὑπόφορος (Cf. ὐποφορά—a hollow passage);
but this view hardly gives sufficient weight
to the evidence that ὔπαφρος existed with
the meaning ‘secret.’ Headlam tenta-

<p>The scene of the play was the neighbourhood of Mt Athos. as
appears from fr. For For the connexion of Thamyras with this
district cf. Eustath. Il. p. 299, 5 καὶ ὅτι ἐν τῇ Ακτῇ τῇ περὶ τὸν

<p>In Homer, as Leaf has pointed out, Thamyras is a travelling
rhapsode, and, whether by Oechalia is meant the Thessalian
or the Messenian town — a point about which even the Alexan-
drian critics were divided (Waser in Pauly-Wissowa VI 1360) —
the scene of his punishment is Dorium in Messene2 (Strabo 350
Pausan. 4. 33. 7). See B 594 — 600

The critics are not agreed whether πηρόν means ‘blind,’ or is to
be explained by the loss of the power of minstrelsy. It will also
be observed that Homer does not speak of a formal contest
between Thamyras and the Muses; and his account might
be taken to imply nothing more than that Thamyras was

Euripides mentions a regular contest, and the punishment of
blindness, but does not state that Thamyras was also dep
of his musical skill. There can hardly be any doubt that both
punishments belonged to the Sophoclean story (cf. frs.
is we shall see. Both are recorded by Apollod. 1. 17, who gives
r particulars of the conditions of the contest : it was agreed,
he says, that if Thamyras was successful, the Muses would a

the blinding of Thamyras, the actor, whose mask could not be
changed, took care to present to the audience the grey eye only.
He quoted Quintil. II, 3. 74 in comoediis. . .pater ille, cuius

maxime latus actoribus moris est, quod cum iis quas agunt partibus
congruat.</p>
<p>We have no indication of the manner in which the plot
was developed. This only is certain, that Thamyras passed
from supreme good fortune to utter misery as the result of
ὕβρις. One scene seems to have attained universal celebrity —
that in which the wretched hero, blind and — what was even
worse — deprived in his blindness of the art which might have
been his solace, in anger snaps the strings of his lyre and
shatters the frame; then, desolate and inconsolable, sits surrounded
by the broken fragments. Such at least is a fair inference from
the works of art described by Pausanias 9. 30. 2 and especially
10. 30. 8 Θαμύριδι δὲ ὲγγὺς καθεζομένῳ τοῦ τοὐ Πελία διεφθαρμέναι

ἔρριπται πρὸς τοῖς ποσι, κατεαγότες αὐτῆς οἱ πήχεις καὶ αἱ χορδαὶ
κατερρωγυιαι.</p>
<p>A circumstance in the Homeric account of Thamyras which
has hardly received any attention is his connexion with Eurytus,
from whose home at Oechalia Thamyras is said to have started
on his way to Dorium. Now, Eurytus is the counterpart of
Thamyras in another sphere : taught the use of the bow by
Apollo, he challenged his master and was slain in punishment
(Horn. θ 224 ff.). These kindred spirits are coupled by Lucian
piscat. 6 ἔσθ᾿ ὅστις οὖν ταῦτα εὖ πεπονθὼς παρ᾿ ὑμῶν κακῶς ἄν
εἰπεῖν ἐπιχειρήσειεν εὐεργέτας ἄνδρας, ἀφ᾿ ὦν εἶναί τις ἔδοξεν;

ἐριδαίνειν, ἐναντία τοξεύων, καὶ ταῦτα δοτῆρι ὄντι τῆς τοξικῆς.
This is probably an instance where the heroes of two similar
stories have been brought into association with each other, just
as Heracles and Eurytus, the rival bowmen, are for different
reasons variously connected.</p>
<p>In Athen. 20 F and vit. Soph. 4 (p. 1 Blaydes) it is said that
Sophocles himself played the harp at the representation of
the play. It is unnecessary to adopt Welcker's view that
Sophocles appeared in the character of Thamyras : in fact,
the writer of the Life negatives this assumption by stating
that Sophocles differed from the older tragedians in that he
relinquished the position of an actor owing to his μικροφωνία.

hero of festal gatherings (Hesych. II p. 300). In regard to its
form, Θαμύρας is said to be the Attic for Θάμυρις (Cyrill. lex. ap.

the intention to give a generic description
of stringed instruments, which would
cover both the λύρα and the κιθάρα.
Ellendt refers to Hesych. ΙΙΙ p. 171
ξόανα· κθρίως δὲ τὲ ἐκ ξύλων εξεσμένα
ἤ λίθων. The lyre was the oldest stringed
instrument and was in general use, whereat
the cithara was for the most part employed
by professional musicians. See Guhl and
Koner, p. 201 ff. ; Susemihl-Hicks on
Arist. pol. p. 601. There was also a
difference of material : the sounding-box
of the lyre was made of tortoise shell, and
that of the cithara with wood or metal.
But it would be wrong to restrict the
meaning of ξόανα so as to make it apply
solely to the wood-work of the cithara.</p>

<p>1 πρόποδα has not been explained ;
but Campbell, who compares προποδίζειν,
not unreasonably suggests that it may
mean ‘ “giving forwardness to the ”
i.e. “inciting to ” ’ That is to
say, the strict sense is ‘moving forward.’
Schneidewin (Rh. Mus. II 297) supposed
that the chorus, followers of Thamyras,
are contrasting the slow processional
chant of the Muses (πρόποδα) with
vigorous and passionate strains which
they have heard τὸ δ’ ὅσα κλύομεν) from
their master. No help is given by the
gloss in Phot. Suid. πρόποδες· μεγάλους
πόδας ἔχοντες. Nauck suggested irpoaooa.
from the reading οφ the cod. Ambr., so
that πρόσοδα μέλεα should = προσόδια;
but there is no evidence for an adj.
πρόσοδος, and there are other objections.
— κλέομεν (see cr. n.) seems to pro-
vide the required sense, and κλύουσαι is
given for κλέουσαι by the codd. in Eur.
Ι. A. 1046. The conjecture, which
occurred to me independently, has been
anticipated by Herwerden, Headlam and
Tucker. Herw. wrote πρόπολε μεγάλε,
τάδε σε κλέομεν. But the break in the
synaphea is objectionable : can τάδε
κλεόμενα be right? Headlam (C. R.
XIII 3) formerly proposed τανυσικνάμονα,
thinking that the corruption was caused
by the compound epithet, — a tendency
illustrated in C. R. XV 17 and in his nn.
on Aesch. Ag. 50, 1480. But the passage
of Arctinus on which he relies (p. 51 K.)
describes the attitude to be adopted in
hurling a spear, and is not relevant ; nor
is the metre satisfactory. Subsequently

<p>No modern critic (with the exception
of Hartung and Immisch, who thought
that the verses formed part of the poetic
display) has credited the statement that
the two hexameter lines really belonged
to the Thamyras. To avoid the difficulty
Kirchhoff suggested the transposition of
the words Ἐπιγόνοις and Θαμύρᾳ, holding
that by the Erigoni was meant the cyclic
poem bearing that title ; and his solution
was accepted by Nauck in his first
edition, hy Dindorf, by Jebb (on O. C.
378), and by Papageorgius in his edition
of the scholia. But it has been completely
refuted by Bergk for the following reasons.
(1) The words ἐν Ἐπιγόνοις in this context
ought prima facie to refer to the play of
Sophocles, and it is highly improbable
that, if the scholiast had intended to
quote the epic, he would have introduced
it in this way. (2) The line which
Kirchhoff would attribute to the Thamyras
(fr. 190) is, so far as we can tell, entirely
unsuitable to that play, whereas it fits
naturally with the plot of the Epigoni.
It is probable, therefore, that if the citation
of the Thamyras was more than a mere
reference, the words quoted have dropped
out of the text. Nauck lakes exception
to the contracted κοῖλος in a cyclic poem,
but he should at least have referred to
Ηom. χ 385. We are not concerned with
the hexameters, but it should be mentioned
that Wilamowitz conjectured ἐκ
μὲν ἄρα χθνίου to make them agree with
the tradition that Autolycus was the son
of Hermes (ἐξ ἐριουνίου ἣ Weil). Others
prefer to suppose that Erichthonius had
a son of this name (Dümmler in Pauly-Wissowa
11 2601). O. Immisch in Jahrb.
f. Philol. Suppl. XVII 155 holds that
the hexameters are correctly quoted from
the play, and that they were part of the
agon which must have been represented
somehow or other in the course of the
action. He points out that Philonis,
who is the subject to ἔσχεθε was mother
of Philammon, the father of Thamyras,
as well as of Autolycus, and that this
genealogy appeared as early as Hesiod
(see fr. 111 Rz. ἣ τέκεν Αὐτόλυκόν τε
Φιλάμμονά τε κλυτὸν αὐδήν). For κοῖλον

<pb n="184"/>
Thamyras but Eudoxus and Aristarchus
and Archimedes : — who, as Plutarch goes
on to illustrate with well-known stories,
were themselves possessed with ecstasy
inspired by their discoveries in science :
Archimedes, for example (1094 c),
ἐννοήσας τὴν τοῦ στεφάνου μέτρησιν οἶον ἔκ
τινος κατοχῆς ἤ ἐπιπνοίας ἐξήλατο βοῶν
“εὕρηκα,” καὶ τοῦτο πολλάκις φθεγγόμενος
ἐβάδιζεν· The melodies of Thamyras
have had an effect upon the speaker such
as those of the musician Alexander had
upon the Romans : he created such a
furore, says Athenaeus (183 E), οὕτως
ἐποίησε πάντας Ῥωμαίους μουσομανεῖν ὡς
τοὺς πολλοὺς καὶ ἀπομνημόνεύειν αὐτοῦ τὰ
κρούσματα. Whatever the verb was,
ποτὶ σειράν is to be constructed with it,
“I was stricken at the ” (the part
which is the instrument of singing), as
in Aesch. Eum. 595, where Orestes says
I slew my mother ξιφουλκῷ χειρὶ πρὸς
δέρην τεμών. The critics, except Βernardakis,
who accepts εὔχομαι and supplies
for it an inf. ἐλᾶν from his conjecture
in the previous line (see cr. n.), reading
ἔρχομαι, have taken ποτὶ δειράν with it,
“and Ι come to the mountain-ridge”; and
since δειράν in that sense has no authority,
Brunck (approved by Ellendt s.v. δειράς)
altered it to ποτὶ δειράδα ἔρχομαι : Campbell
too translates “and make my way to
the ” but doubts, conjecturing ποτὶ
δ’ εἴραν ἔρχομαι “and I go to the public
” ἔχομαι is used for κατέχομαι, as
e.g. ἔχω appears for προσέχω in Phil. 305.
The usual phrases were οὐ γὰρ ἐκ Μουσῶν,
ἀλλ᾿ ἐΚ Κορυβάντων τινῶν κατέχεσθε Dio
Chrys. I 682, κατάσχετος ἐκ Νυμφῶν
Pausan. 10. 12. 11, κάτοχος ἐκ Μουσῶν
Lucian 11 5. Cf. Plat. Ιοn 536 A Καὶ ὁ

ἐξ ‘Ομήρου.᾿ ἔχομαι is probably correct,
and completes the restoration initiated by
Porson (on Med. 284) of the latter part
of the fragment. But the first line is
desperately corrupt ; and I cannot feel
satisfied that Brunck's δακέτῳ, though
diplomatically excellent, is suitable to the
present context. It has not been observed
that μουσομανεῖ may be a verb ; and I incline
to this solution, with ποτὶ δειράν=
towards the throat, as in Aesch. Ag. 3 340
οὐΚέτ’ ἐξ ἐλευθέρου | δέρης ἀποιμώζουσι
φιλτάτων μόρον. The sense of the intervening
words, which must then contain
the subject, might be given by reading
μουσομανεῖ δ᾿ ἀναθρὲν (or possibly even
δὲ λαμφθὲν λῆμ᾿ ἀνεκὰς ποτὶ δειράν, — or
as the accent of cod. Pal. suggests, μουσομανεῖ
δ᾿ ἐλαφὴν ᾆσμ᾿ ἄνετον ποτὶ δειραν.
Herwerden conjectured in v. 1 f. ποτὶ δ᾿
οὐρανὸν αἴρομαι (so also Wyttenbach) ἔκ
τε λύρας κτἑ. Wyttenbach's view that
Καὶ τό are simply the words of Plutarch
linking together two quotations deserves
passing mention. Mekler conjectured
after δακέτῳ, ποτὶ δ᾿ ἱρὰν ἔρχομαι δαῖτ᾿ ἔκ
κτἑ., i.e. to the banquet of the Muses.</p>
<p>The metre is of the Icnic (choriambic)
type, but for obvious reasons the analysis
is doubtful. It should be added that H.
was led partly by metrical considerations
to his conjecture ἔχομαι. The anaclomenos
περίαλλα μουσοποιεῖ is a common
clausula in Ionics : see e.g. Aesch. Suppl.
1043.</p>
<p>OHIEYI</p>
<p>Welcker (p. 402) holds that the solitary reference to this paly
is an error, and that the Phaedra was the play intended. There is
no reason why Sophocles should not have written a play entitled
Theseus, just as Euripides did, who dramatized the Cretan
adventure under that title. The evidence in its favour is very
slender, and may be untrustworthy ; but we ought not to refuse
to credit it without some stronger reason than Welcker is able to
adduce. The subject must in any case be uncertain : Welcker

<pb n="185"/>
records a baseless guess by Gruppe that it comprised the death of
Theseus in Scyros (Plut Cim. 8 etc.). If the title is an error,
the most probable solution is to ascribe the quotation to the
us (p. 51).</p>

mention here of the oracle to Thyestes that the

<pb n="186"/>
son born to him by his daughter Pelopia was destined to be
the avenger of his brother's crime. This essential part of the
legend appears, however, in the brief and mutilated chapter
which precedes (fab. 87), as well as in the imperfect account of
Apollodorus (epit. 2. 14). Cf. Lactant. on Stat. Theb. 1. 694 cum
responsum accepisset Thyestes aliter malorum remedium inveniri
non posse, nisi cum Pelopea filia concubuisset, paruissctque
responsis, etc. The last quotation should not lead us to suppose
that in the original form of the story Thyestes recognized his
daughter, although the account of Hyginus is far from explicit
on this point. Anyhow, so far as Sophocles is concerned, it is
hardly necessary to appeal to the testimony of Aristotle (poet. 13.
1453a 9 — 11), in order to refute such an inference being drawn
concerning his version. The confusion in Hyginus between
Thesprotus and the king of Sicyon becomes still more puzzling
in the second division of the chapter : in consequence of a
drought at Mycenae, Atreus was ordered by the oracle to bring
back Thyestes. He accordingly journeyed to the court of
Thesprotus, thinking that Thyestes was there, saw Pelopia,
whom he believed to be the daughter of Thesprotus, and asked for
her hand in marriage. Thesprotus, ’to avoid any · — a
mysterious comment — consented. But Pelopia was already pregnant
by Thyestes, and exposed the child when born. The
shepherds, however, gave him to a she-goat to suckle (Aegisthus).
and Atreus had a search made for him, and brought him up as
his own son. The concluding section in Hyginus is so closely
compressed that it may as well be given in his own words :
interim Atreus mittit Agamemnonem et Menelaum filios ad
quaerendum Thyestem : qui Delphos petiernnt sciscitatum. casu
Thyestes eo venerat ad sortes tollendas de ultione fratris. compre-
hensus ab eis ad Atrenm perdncitur. quern Atreus in custodiam
coniici iussit Aegisthumque vocat, existimans suum filium esse, et
mittit eum ad Thyestem interficieudum. Thyestes cum vidisset
Aegisthum et gladium quern Aegisthus gerebat et cognovisset quem
in compressione perdiderat, interrogat Aegisthum, nude illum
haberet. ille respondit matrem sibi Pelopiam dedissc : quam iubet
accersiri. cui respondit se in compressione nocturua nescio cui
eduxisse et ex ea compressione Aegisthum concepisse. tunc Pelopia
gladium arripuit simulans se agnoscerc (?) et in pectus sibi detrusit:
quern Aegisthus e pectore matris omentum tenens ad Atrenm
attulit. ille existimans Thyestem interfectum laetabatur : quern
Aegisthus in littore sacrificantem occidit et cum patre Thyeste in
regnum avitum redit.</p>
<p>Brunck inferred that the material for two plays was to be
found in the chapter of Hyginus, and that the scene of the

<pb n="187"/>
earlier was to be placed at Sicyon, that of the later at Mycenae.
Curtailed and abbreviated as the text of Hyginus obviously is,
an scarcely fail to recognize the influence of a tragedian in
the concluding portion, more particularly in the ἀναγνώρισις and
the suicide of Pelopia. But the earlier events are inconclusive, and
not well suited, so far as we can judge, to dramatic representa-
Agreeing, therefore, with Brunck that Sophocles' play
κυῶνι was the ultimate source of Hyginus, I think
it more likely that the earlier incidents, so far as they were
material to the issue, were made known to the spectators either
in the prologue or in the course of the action, and did not form
(??)ubject of a separate drama. It can hardly be doubted that
(??)7 alludes to the oracle given to Thyestes, but the words
quite well have been spoken after its prediction had been
fulfilled. Rossbach (Philol. Abhandl. M. Hertz dargebracht,
5) inferred from Hygin. fab. 254 Pelopia Thyestis filia in
patron (sc. piissima fuit) ut eum vindicaret that Pelopia knew of
trade and recognized her father, but nevertheless submitted
grace in order to secure his revenge. Welcker (p. 369) takes
a different view, thinking that the subject of the second Th(??)
and of the Pelopidae of Accius is to he found in Hygin. fab. 86
Thyestes Pelopis et Hippodamiae filius quod earn Aeropa Aeropa tret
concubuit a fratre Atreo de regno est eiectus. At is Atret
filium Plisthenem, quem pro suo educanerat, ad Atreum int (??)
endum misit : quern Atreus Credens fratris filium esse imprudens
filium suum occidit. This is a pure guess, prompted by the
ity of finding a plot for the second Thyestes, and it is
much more likely that Hygin 86 is based on the Pleisthen
Euripides (TGF p. 556). Dindorf solves the problem by his
device of a second edition (see p. 4).</p>
<p>It should be added that the incest of Thnestes is alluded to
tragic subject by Plat. legg. 838 C. See also I Friedlaender

(Krit. Stud. 1 254), who rewrites the
passage in order to avoid the supposed
incompatibility of ἔξω δἰκης with αἰσχρὸν
οὐδέν. Βut all the lines appear to be
part of an answer to an objection (of
Thyestes?) that, if the oracle pointed to
incest, its injunction must be disregarded:
see Introductory Note. The reply is that
such considerations cannot be allowed,
since human wisdom is of no avail unless
it is blessed by heaven. The attitude
towards σοφἱα is similar to that of Eur.
Bacch. 200 ff. and other passages in the
same play ; in Sophocles it does not
surprise us. For θεὸς τιμᾷ cf. Aesch fr.

Schmidt adds Hes. Theog. 81, Theogn.

<p>2 ff. These lines have been cleared
up by Wecklein's proposal to insert σ’
and treat κελεύῃ as second pers. sing, of
the pass, subjunctive. The same suggestion
was made independently by Tucker
(C.R. XVII 190) and by Blaydes, who,
however, inclined to εἰς θεόν σ’ ὁρᾶν τε
κτἑ. The insertion οφ σ’ appears to have
been proposed first by Seyffert (Rh. Mus.
xv 615), but he wished to substitute θεόν
for θεούς, in order to provide κελεύῃ with
a subject. It is natural to compare the
passage with Euripides' famous line (fr.
292, 7) εἰ θεοί τι δρῶσιν αἰσχρόν, οὐΚ εἰσὶν
θεοί, and the contrast is significant of the
attitude of the two poets towards morality
and religion. Sophocles is serenely confident
that no reconciliation of their
claims is necessary ; if morality
to conflict with the will of the gods, so
much the worse for it. But for Euripides.
if the gods seem to enjoin an immoral
action, they become untrue to their
nature and are no longer trustworthy.
See Nestle's article on Sophokles und
die Sophistik in Class. Philol. v 1 29 ff.
The present lines would accurately describe
the position of Orestes in the
Electra, who has no hesitation in obeying
the command of Apollo, even though it
involves matricide: see v. 1424 τὰν
δόμοισι μὲν | καλῶς, Απόλλων εὶ καλῶς
ἐθέσπισεν, and Jebb's Introd. p. xli. —
ὁδοιπορεῖν is used 10 times by Sophocles,
but not at all by Aeschylus or Euripides.
For ἔξω δίκης cf. Eur. Αndr. 786, Bacch.
1010 τὰ δ’ ἔξω νόμιμα | δίκας ἐκβαλόντα
τιμᾶν θεούς. The context here limits σἰκη
to the sphere of established or conventional
morality. The conception of δίκη
as a human institution was as old as
Hesiod (Op. 279): cf. Plat. Prot. 322 C.
The word is so applied in accordance with
its original meaning of custom or order,

<p>The explanatory words ‘decisions, recommendations,

to refer to the approval of an assembly

acclamation. Such was the Spartan
ἄπελλα: Thuc. 1. 87 κρίνουσι γὰρ βοῇ
καὶ οὐ ψήφῳ. See further Greenidge,

p. 100. In this respod no doubt
Sparta adhered to the procedure of the
heroic age: cf. Hom. T 461 ὡς ἔφατ᾿

probable that Alecacus used ἐπαινἐτης of a
political supporter rather than that ταῖς
ἐπαινέταισιν is correct. Bergk's alternative
suggestions that Sophocles wrote ὄς

ταισιν alone are very unlikely.</p>

Σοφοκλῆς Θυέστῃ β΄. Cf. ibid. p. 341
ἀφωσιωμένε· ἄποθεν τοῦ ὁσίου ἀφωρισμένε.</p>
<p>The important word ἀφοσιοῦν, more
common in the middle, cannot be fully
treated here. The meaning attested by
Hesych. arises from the double sense of
dedication, seen in such words as devotus,
soar, ἄγος, which has been well compared
by Miss Harrison (Prolegomena, pp. 59
108) with the condition of the savage
tabu. Thus ἀφοσιοῦν, to separate from
the ὅσια, is to make an ἄγος or tabu ; and
a φαρμακός would properly be described
as ἀφωσιωμένος. Cf. Hipponax fr. 11
ὡς οἱ μὲν ἄγει Βουπάλῳ κατηρῶντο. In
this sense ἀφοσιοῦν is equivalent to
ἐναγίζειν, and is contrasted with ἀφαγνίζειν,
to remove from the tabu or to disenchant,
for which cf. Eur. Alc. 11 44.
and ἀφιεροῦν, which has the same meaning
in Aesch. Εum. 454 (of Orestes, as
ἀφαγνίζειν in Pausan. 2. 31. 8). Hence
ἀφοσιοῦσθαι commonly = to abominate
(aversari) : see Holden on Plut. Sull. 22.

editors all prefer the rendering ‘Ι was
considered' ; but there is no gain to
sense in its adoption, and, if the editors
are right, the present gloss of Hesychius
does not deserve credit. Yet ἠγόμην,
’I ’ seems to be justified by the
corresponding use of the active in Dem. 9.

been inferred with reason that Nysa was
in the immediate neighbourhood of
Aegae, a town on the west coast of

Aegae was opposite to Anthedon at a
distance of 120 stades across the Euripus.

Trach. 219, 510, 704, in all of which
places they give forms of βακχεῖος against
the mater. The only certain instance of
βακχεῖος in Sophocles is O. T. 1105. In
Euripides βακχεῖος is certain in Hec. 686,
Ion 1126, Bacch. 1057; and Elmsley on
Bacch. 308 held that Euripides avoided
βάκχιος except as the name of the god.
These facts are hardly sufficient to warrant
the adoption of βάκχιος, although it may
very well be right. For the accentuation
βακχεῖος rather than βάκχειος see

Μ. Schmidt's λιβρᾶς (cr. n.) is based on
λιβρὸν σέλας (Tr. fr. adesp. 233).</p>
<p>4 κεκλημάτωται:‘the green vineshoot
puts forth its tendril.’ The early
growth of the vine is described distributively
in respect of each twig. The
proper meaning of οἰνάνθη is given by
schol. Ar. Au. 588 as ἡ πρώτη ἔκφυσις
τῆς σταφυλῆς: so Hesych., Suid., schol.
Ar. Ran. 1320. It should be observed
that in none of the passages quoted by
L. and S. for that meaning is οἰνάνθη
used for the vine itself. There is consequently
the less reason for following J.,
who, taking οἰνάνθης δέμας as the vinestock,
treated χλωρόν as proleptic:‘the
stock of the vine has put forth green
shoots.’ The perfect is gnomic as in
El. 64 εῖθ᾿ ὅταν δόμονς | ἔλθωσιν αὐθις,
ἐκτετίμηνται πλέον. See Gildersleeve,
§ 257, Goodw. § 155.</p>
<p>5 μέσσον is used by Sophocles in
dialogue also at Ant. 1223, 1236. Eur.
only employs the form in lyrics. In this
respect the Ionism of Sophocles is well-known:
see on fr. 799, 4.—ὄμφακος
τύπον, the form of the unripe grape.</p>
<p>καὶ κλίνεταί τε is undoubtedly
right. Such conjectures as πεπαίνεταί τε
(Nauck) and γλυκαίνεταί τε (Meineke)
are quite beside the marke, as was recognized
by Gomperz and independently by
Headlam. ‘And, as it wanes, the cluster
is empurpled.’ For the use of τε...καί in
place of ὅτε of contemporancous events
see Kuchner-Gerth, § 516, 8 (11 231),
and H. on Aesch. Ag. 189. The credit
of first advocating the claims of τε here
belongs to Wex on Ant. 1164 (1186).—
κάποπερκοῦται exresses the final change
of colour when teh grape is ripe: see n.
on Eur. Phoen. 1160. There is a good
illustration in Achill. Tat. 2. 3, describing
the appearance of a gemmed cup: οἱ δὲ
βότρυες πάντῃ περιςρεμάμενοι· ὅμφαξ μὲν
αὐτῶν ἔκαστος ὄσον ἦν κενὸς ὁ κρατήρ· ἐὰν
δ᾿ ἐγχέῃς οἶνον, κατὰ μικρὸν ὁ βότρυς
ὐποπερκάζεται καὶ σταφυλὴν τὴν
δμφακα ποιεῖ. For this sense of

<p>σταφυλή cf. Α. Ρ. 5. 303 ὄμφαξ οὐκ
ἐπένευσας· ὅτ᾿ ἦς σταφυλή, παρεπέμψω
κτἐ. There does not seem to be any
reason for preferring κἀπιπερκοῦται, as
suggested by Nauck : in Α. Ρ. 11. 36
(quoted on Phoen. l.c.) the conditions are
different. In Chaeremon fr. 12 πολλὴν
ὀπώραν Κύπριδος εἰσορᾶν παρῆν | ἄκραισι
περκάζουσαν οἰνάνθαις χρόνου (γένυν
Kaibel) the text is corrupt, but the reference
is clearly to early maturity.</p>
<p>7 f. βλαστουμένη is generally considered
to be corrupt, but no satisfactory
emendation has been proposed. Meineke's
κλάστου χερί (‘‘κλαστουμένη would be
‘ H. [cf. C. R. XVIII 243]: alternatives
are τέχνῃ or μένει, the latter
suggested but not approved by
Herwerden), which he subsequently gave up
in favour of βλαστοῦ γονὴ | ὀπωροκλάστῃ
τᾆτα, is put out of court by the consideration
that an allusion to the vine-dresser's
art is irrelevant : not trimming the leaves
to let the fruit ripen, but gathering it
when ripe is the process to which a
reference is required. Barnes's alteration
in the order of the words — καλῶς ὀπώρα —
is probably right, and the error may be
due, as H. thought, to what he called
’simple ’ (C. R. XVI 245). On the
other hand R. Ellis conjectured ὀπωριαῖος
for ὀπώρα καλῶς. But καλῶς itself is not
satisfactory, at any rate so long as
βλαστουμένη stands: neither Campbell's
attaining a perfect ’ nor J.
its full ’ — lit. ‘growing ’
can be maintained. Even if the form is
legitimate, βλ. ὀπώρα (= the ripe fruit
growing) is an odd phrase. The existence
of a transitive βλαστέω is proved by Ap.
Rhod. 1. 1131, and that of the j
by Philo's βίος βλαστῃθείς (1 667 Μ.) ;
but the present tense is in any case out
of place here. Bergk's ἐβλαστημενη
avoided this difficulty. Trach. 703
χλαυκῆς ὀπώρας ὥστε πίονος ποτοῦ
χυθέντος εἰς γῆν Βακχίας ἀπ᾿ ἀμπέλου
shows that ποτόν is the juice of the grape,
and we should expect to find some
allusion not merely to the gathering of
the vintage, but to the pouring of the
fruit into the vat or its treading by the
vintagers. The first requirement would
be satisfied by τρυγωμένη, the second by
τραπουμένη or πατουμένη — or even by
βατουμένη (cf. ληνοβάτης), the last a word
which might possibly have given place to
βλαστουμένη, but like τραπουμένη and
πατουμένη cannot be combined with
τέμενεται. Perhaps τέμνεται, βατουμένης
ὅπως ὀπώρας κἀναίρνηται ποτόν. Observe
how easily ὅπως would have been lost,
which would lead to subsequent patching.
Herwerden proposed βάκχαις for καλῶς
on the strength of schol. Hom. N 21

more likely that χρή arose in this way in

accepted in v. 3. F. W. Schmidt followed
Badham, and also without necessity gave

<p>ory of Io was contained in two epics attributed to
Hesiod, the Aegimius and kat;aloyol, but the information relateing
to them is so scanty that it is impossible to reconstruct
ttther version detail1. The other literary evidence anterior to
Sophocles consists of the incidents recorded in the Supplices and
schylus, to which there is now to be added the
dithyramb of Bacchylides (18). In Apollod. 2. 5 ff. we find a
n of the story which in several respects from

accounts given of the death of Argus. In the Prometheus (707)
Aeschylus speaks vaguely of his sudden and unexpected end, and
in the Supplices (309) merely states that he was killed by Hermes.
According to Apollodorus (2. 7), who appears to be following
Hesiod (fr. 189 Rz.), Hermes was biden by Zeus to steal the
cow, and, failing to elude Argus, killed him with a stone. But
’s account Μet. 1 668 ff.) is different: Hermes disguised
himself as a shepherd, excited the curiosity of Argus by playing
on the pipe, and, when he had eventually succeeded in lulling
him to sleep, slew him with the ἄρπη. The antiquity of the
latter version is proved by Bacchylides (18. 29 — 36), who, in
refusing to pronounce definitely on the manner of ’s death,
mentions, as an alternative, that he may have been ’lulled to rest
by the sweet melody of the Pierian sisters ’ (see Jebb in loc).</p>
<p>The inference that the Inachus was a satyr-play was first
drawn by Hemsterhuis1, and the general tone of the fragments
has convinced the majority of subsequent critics that he was
right, although Bergk2 and Wilamovitz3 were of a different
opinion. The latter considered that the play was technically
a tragedy in spite of its jovial character, and compared it to
the Alcestis of Euripides. I doubt if the analogy will hold.
The comic element in the Alcestis is slight enough; yet the
ancient critics thought it σατυρικώτερον, and the general opinion
is summarized by Demetr. de eloc. 169 τραυῳδία δὲ χάριτα μέν
παραλαμβάνει ἐν πολλοῖς, ὁ δὲ γέλως έχθρὸς τραγῳδίας* ούδὲ γὰρ
ὲπινοήσειεν ἄν τις τραγῳδίαν παίξουσαιν, έπεὶ σάτυρου γράψει
άντὶ τραγῳδίας. So much was this the case that Rhinthon of
Tarentum, a specimen of whose art is perhaps preserved in the
Αmphitryo of Plautus, was regarded as the inventor of a new
type of drama known as IXaporpaywBia. Wilamowitz has a formidable
argument in the fact that twenty-six quotations from the
play have come down to us without any hint that it was satyric;
and it is perhaps not an adequate answer to point out that the
same remark applies to the nine fragments belonging to the
Αχιλλέως έρασταί. But the more famous the play the less need
was there to cite it with a title distinctive of its character; and
it is common ground that the Inachus was much more popular
than any of the plays of Sophocles which are definitely known
as satyrich4. It should be added that the death of Argus is a

roted as trying to kill Argus, who is asleep on the
ground, but as being held back by ’. Even if this does
not refer directly to the Inachus, it is sufficient to show that the
subject was suitable for satyric treatment.</p>
<p>Something may be gathered from the fragments themselves
the scope of the play. Inachus. the river-god, was the
father of lo (frs. 270, 271, 284); but there is nothing to show
what part he took in the action. It may be assumed that the
scene of the ρΙaγ was the flowery vale of Argos, rich with
pasture, where lo ranged before her wanderings began: cf. EL 5

έπωπάς, | λειμῶνα βούχιλον, evdev ἔνθεν Ἰώ κτὲ. This descrip
of the Argive plain (πολυδίψιον: see generally
in. 111 p. 96) might well excite surprise; but Headlam has
ted out that it refers to the particular circumstances of the
legend, by quoting Severus in Walz, Rhet. Gr. 1 Ρ. 537 τιμῶσα
9 γῆ τὴν τοῦ Διὸς έρωμένην ἄνθος άνῆκε τῆ Βοΐ νεέμεσθαι. It
is perhaps not altogether fanciful to connect the allusion of the
rician with the account given in the Inchachus of the blessings
wed on the inhabitants of Argos when Zeus came to visit
10 (frs. 273, 275, 286). 286). To Inachus in particular, as the
f nourishment for all the dwellers on his bank

enlarged honours. Hermes and Iris appeared as the agents of

representation. The transformation of ’took placeduring

by reducing the land to poverty as a punishment for the com-

race, with pride, as sprung from the
ancient stock of the Pelasgi. Cp. Thuc.
4. 109, who traces a Pelasgic element in
the Athos peninsula, descended from τῶν
καἰ Δῆμνόν ποτε καὶ ’Αθήνας Τυρσηνῶν
οὶκησάντων. In the fifth century the view
prevailed that the Hvpo-rjvoi and Pelasgi
were identical. [In Hdt. 1. 57 τοῖσι νῶν
ἔτι Πελασγῶν τῶν ύπὲρ Τυρσηνῶν Κρηστῶνα
πόλιν οὶκόντων, Κρότωνα, i.e. Cortona —
with Κροτωνιῆται for Κρηστωνιῆται below
— should perhaps be substituted: see
Stein.] Hellanicus (fr. 1, FHG 1 45)
says that the Pelasgi acquired the name
of Τυρσνηοί after their arrival in Italy.
The Etruscans were believed to have come
originally from Lydia (Hdt. 1. 94).
Herodotus (8. 73) regards the people of
Cynuria in the S. of Argolis as having
been originally Pelasgic. So the inhabitants
of Achaia, he says, were originally
called Pelasgi, and acquired the name
of Ionians only after they left it. In
Arcadia the first king was Pelasgus
(Pausan. 8. 1. 4).᾿ The evidence
connects the Pelasgian name with Argos
is particularly strong, and is difficult to
account for as due merely to a mistaken
interpretation of Homer's ΙΙελασγικὸν
Ἄργος (B 681): see nn. on Eur. Hclid.
316, phoen. 107. Aeschylus in the
Danaides (fr. 46) traces the Pelasgians to
the neighbourhood of Mycenae, and in
the Supplices (257 ff.) Pelasgus is the king
of Argos after whom the inhabitants are
named Pelasgi. See Ridgeway, Early
Age of Greece, pp. 90, 94. It is impossible
within the limits of a note to summarize
recent speculation concerning the Pelasgians
and Tyrrhenians, and the relations
of both to the Etruscans. Those who
identify Pelasgi and Tyrseni explain the
latter name as a descriptive epithet
referring to the towers with which they
protected their settlements (Murray,
Rise of Greek Epic, Ρ. 41). Ridgeway,

<pb n="201"/>
on the other hand, regards Τyrrhenian
Pelasgians as those Pelasgians who having
lived with the Τyrrhenians (Etruscans)
had been more or less influened by 
them (l. c. p. 146). Skutsch (in Pauly-Wissowa 
VI 730 ff.) considers the identity 
of the Tyrseni and Etrusci to be established 
beyond dispute, and that the latter 
reached Italy from the East by sea; but 
he also denies that they have any conexion 
with the Pelasgians, holding folk,
who occupied settlements on the islands 
and the coasts of the mainland. See also 
Holm, Greek History, Eng. tr. I p. 60f.,
who accepts the view that the importance 
of the Pelasgians has been much exaggerated, 
and that their influence was 
confined to Epirus and Thessaly. J. L. 
Myres in JHS XXVII 215 traces the 
application of the name Pelasgian
to Peloponnesian Argos to a misinterpretation 
of the Πελασγικὸν Ἀργος of Homer. 
Further, inasmuch as the names Pelasgian 
and Tyrrhenian were recognized in the fifth 
century as somehow or other connected
(Thuc. l. c.), the latter in close association 
with the former acquired a general 
connotative sense of ‘pre-Hellenic in the 
Aegean.’</p>

<p>J. writer: ‘The river Inachus in 
Epeirus is here fabled to be indentical with 
the Inachus of Argolis, being connected 
with it by a submarine (and subterranean) 
channel. (1) The Epeirot Inachus rises 
“from the (northern) extremity of Pindus, 
and Lacmos.” Mt Lacmos, or Lacmon, 
the great watershed of northern Greece, 
is in the NE. of Epeirus. It is a link 
between the Cambynian mountains on 
the E., and Pindus on the S. “Lacmon,”
probably = “rifted,” being akin to λάκκος, 
“a hollow,” and λακίς, “a rent” (Tozer, 
p. 52), referring to the deep valleys which 
cleave the range.</p> 
<p>The Inachus rises in Lacmon; and its 
valley runs south, roughly parallel with 
Pindus. If flows through the highland 
country of the Perrhachi—an Epeirot 
branch of the tribe who gave the name of 
Perrhaebia to a district of Hestiaeotis in 
N. Thessaly. It skirts the territory of 
the Amphilochian Argos, at the E. end 
of the Ambracian Gulf, sending out 
branches, on one of which stood the town 
of Argos, and then, near the NE. border 
of Acarnania, it flows into the Achelöus, 
which, rising, like the Inachus, in 
Lacmon, divides Acarnania on the W. 
from Aetolia on the E., and flows into 
the sea at the SW. extremity of Acarnania, 
near Oeniadae. [For Achelöus, see on 
Tr. 9.]</p> 
<p>(2) The Argive Inachus rises in the 
highlands between Argolis and Arcadia, 
one part of which was called Artemision, 
and another Lyrceion. It flows through 
the district belonging to the town of 
Lyrceia (about seven miles NW. of Argos), 
which is fittingly named in the text as 
being the first place of note in Argolis 
traversed by the river.’</p>
<p>2 ἀπό does not suffer anastrophe 
(Chandler, § 916).—Περραιβῶν is partitive 
genitive after Λάκμου: ‘and from Lacmos 
in the Perrhaebi.’ In prose the article 
would be required with Περραιβῶν: 
Kuehner-Gerth 1 338.</p> 
<p>3 Ἀμφιλόχους. The name is traced 
to Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus and 
brother of Alcmacon. Thucydides (2. 68) 
refers the foundation of this Western 
Argos to Amphilochus after his return 
from Troy; but Ephorus (FHG 1 240) 
said that it was founded by Alcmacon 
after the expedition of the Epigoni, and 
named after his brother, and that the 
river which flows through the country 
into the Ambracian gulf was called 
Inachus at the same time (Strabo 325). 
This is the branch mentioned above.

There is another Lyrcus also connected

Pausanias l.c. calls the place Lyrceia,
and says that it was deserted as early as

J. would prefer the adjective AvpKtiov
here. But the name Αύρκειον is supported
by Hesychius and Strabo (376), both of

No doubt Δύρκειον was strictly the name

<p>It is to be feared that this cryptic

κυνῆς, which may be taken in two ways:
(1) κυκλἀς may be substantival with the
sense of ‘brim’ (so Toup): ‘there's a round
Arcadian ᾿ (2) κυκλάς may be an
adjective, = ’encompassed’ or ’covered.’
Neither supposition is quite satisfactory.
Nauck prints γυνὴ τίς ἥδε γυμνάς; Απκάδος
κυκῆ from his own conjecture, which I do
not understand; but there is something
to be said for his remark that ’ApKddos

against the evidence of the scholiast. R.
Ellis conjectured γυνὴ τίς; ἤ κυλλνηὶς

suggestion, but no reading will be satisfactory
which does not put ᾿ Απκάς (or
᾿ Απκάδος) in agreement with κυνῆ (or
κυνῆς). That is demanded by the gloss
of Hesychius, and is an essential condition
of the problem. Blaydes conj. ffreyavos

from Ar. Αν. 1205 ὄνομα δέ σοι τί

of the scholiast that both in

head-gear, a travelling hat for a journey,
would be appropriate to Iris in her
capacity of messenger, being a variety of
the πέτασος which was worn I
see Guhl and Koner, ρ. 171. If we
might assume that ywti was no part of

read τἰς ἤδε συλήσασά μ᾿ ᾿ Αρκάδος κυνῆς;
Ηermes resented the appropriation
of his own emblem. For the connexion
mes with Arcadia see Horn. h.
2 etc. M. Mayer in Roscher 11
346 thinks that the schol. was altogether
in referring to the viraaot, and
that a high-crowned hat with side-flaps
is meant (Hesych. ᾿ s πῖλος is right). But
he goes farther, and supposes that ᾿ Ιριδος
was an error for ᾿ Ιοῦς, and that Hermes
alluded to the horns growing from Io's
head: so he would introduce σελήνη or
σεληνίς, but biled to tit it to the verse.

was particularly associated with
that of demeter at Eleusis: Farnell, 111

<p>The giving of the name Pluton to Hades
is euphemistic emistic (cf. flat. Crai. 403 A kal

(no earlier instance than Ant. 1200 is

freedom is illustrated by Aesch. Prom.
831 οἵ χρυσόρρυτον | οὶκοῦσιν άμφὶ νᾶμα
Πλούτωνος πόρον. It is in relation to the
gold-mines of Spain that Strabo 147 quotes
a remarkable passage of Posidonius: οὐ
πλουσία μόνον άλλὰ Καὶ ὑπόπλουτος ἦν,
φησίν, ἡ χώρα* παρ' έκείνοις ώς ὡς ἀληθῶς
τὸν ὑποχθόνιον τόπον οὐχ ὁ Ἅιδης ἀλλ᾿ ὁ

that in the Attic mines men work so
zealously, ώς ἄν προσδοκώντων αύ τὸν άνάξειν
τὸν Πλούτωνα — to bring the
wealth-god himself to the surface.
H. quotes from the lines on the εἰρεσιώνη
attributed to Homer (v. 3) αύταὶνακλίνεαθε

in the same way as a modern commentator

employed as well when it is desired to
illustrate a single phrase (schol. Aesch.
Prom. 7, comparing Horn. I 212), as
when two longer passages are compared
(schol. Soph. EI. 95, comparing Horn.
λ 408φff.). Here there is a comparison of
the whole description in the two plays
(cf. fr. 273); but we need not infer that
Aristophanes was closely imitating or
parodying the language of Sophocles.

whether his mccess was measured by the

ξανθή describes the red glow of the
wine, as it sparkles in the light. Hut
el was not thinking of red wine, as
conrrulerl with white; still less could the
word signify a light-coloured (yellow)
wine, in comparison with a darker shade.
That ξανθός in certain respects answers to
our use of red may be deduced not only
from Antipater of Sidon's ξανθὸν έρεύθεται
Α.Ρ. 13. 97) of a handsome boy, but
also from its application to horses, lions,
and oxen, and especially to fire ( this is
the point of Pindar fr. 122 αῖτε τᾶς χλωρᾶς
λιβάνου ξανθὰ σάκρυα | θυμιᾶτε, and fr.
79b αὶθομένα δὲ δᾴς ύπὸ ξανθαῖσι πεύκαις).

brightness than of the actual colour of
the liquid. —ἐπεκτύτει: sec cr, n. H.

festivity, and of the joys consequent upon

βασιλεὺς Κρόνος ἦν τὸ παλαιόν, | ὅτε τοῖς

redeunt Saturnia regna. The chief 
literary authority for the fable was Hes. 
Op. 111—122, from whch it appears that 
ἀφθίτου does not imply immortality, but 
freedom from pain and decay: οἳ μὲν ἐπὶ 
Κρόνου ἦσαν, ὅτ᾿ οὐρανῷ ἐμβασίλευεν· | ὥστε 
θεοὶ δ᾿ ἔζωον ἀκηδέα θυμὸν ἔχοντες, | νόσφιν

δαίμονες ἐσθλοί, guardians of mortal men 
(122).</p> 
<p>1f. γέννας: for the gen. after λαγχάνω 
cf. O. C. 450 ἀλλ᾿ οὔ τι μὴ λάχωσι τοῦδε 
συμμάχου. Blaydes would read τυχόντες.—
It is clear that something is wrong with 
θείου, not merely in respect of its gender, 
but also because the metre unaccountably 
halts. Bergk read ἀφθίτου θείας λαχόντες 
with dactylo-epitritic rhythm; but in denying 
that an ithyphallic occurs after an 
enhoplius, except at the conclusion of a 
system. he was in error, as appears from 
O. T. 196f., where the scansion is: — &#xECE2;
&#x23D6; &#xECE1; &#x23D6; &#xECE2; &#xECE1; | — &#x23D1; — &#x23D1; — —. See Nauck 
in Jahrb. f. Philol. CV 803 ff. The 
rhythm of Trach. 960 f. is similar, but 
those lines form the close of a strophe. 
Tucker (C.R. XVIII 245) suggested ἀφθίτου 
λαχόντες αἰοῦς, taking γέννας as a 
causal genitive with εὐδαίμονες. This is 
metrically unexceptionable, and is exactly 
parallel to Trach. 822 f., but it is somewhat 
hazardous to introduce the unexampled 
αἰοῦς by way of conjecture. On the 
whole, it seems safest simply to delete 
θείου with Herwerden; for, though is can 
hardly have been a gloss, the word may 
have been attached to the quotation accidentally. 
It is perhaps worth mentioning 
that the scholiast continues with θέασαι. 
If λαχόντες is retained, Blaydes suggests 
αἶσαν for θείου. — The language resembles

<p>For χελώνης M. Schmidt conjectured 
κορώνης, and Wecklein χελύνης; and Herwerden 
recast the line as τραχὺς δὲ φωνῆς 
κέρχνος ἐξανίεται. Mekler understands: 
‘a harsh croaking resounds from the lyre.’
For this sense of κέρχνος cf. fr. 314, 128. 
But the text aptly describes the growth 
of the cow's horns on the maiden's 
brow, and the suspicion directed against 
χελώνης appears to be unwarranted. Cf. 
Philostr. vit. Apoll. 1. 19. The genitive 
is descriptive—rough as a tortoise: cf. 
Ant. 114 λευκῆς χιόνος πτέρυγι στεγανός, 
where the schol. is: λείπει δὲ τὸ ὡς ἵν᾿ ᾖ 
ὡς χιόνος. This explains the origin of 
the MS reading: ᾧ was actually ὡς, an 
explanatory adscript, and ὡς is itself found 
as a correction in cod. D (Paris. 2177). 
For the confusion of ᾧ and ὡς cf. e.g. 
Pollux 2. 172. [Headlam, making the 
same suggestion (J.P. XXXI 9), quotes 
examples of ὡς from schol. Aesch. Eum. 
159, Theb. 820.]</p> 
<p>κέρχνος is any kind of hard excrescence 
rising from a smooth surface. Phot. s.v. 
explains τραχύ τι ἐν τοῖς ἐνωτίοις (‘qu.
μετώποις᾿ H.). See Hesych. II p. 470
s.vv. κερχνῶσαι and κέρχνωμα: for ἀσπίδων 
κερχνώμασιν in Eur. Phoen. 1386 see note 
in loc. So κερχνωτά (Hesych.) are cups 
with embossed lips, cymbia . . . aspera signis 
(Verg. Aen. 5. 267), inaequales berullo 
phialas (Juv. 5. 38). Add Hesych. II 
p. 469 κέρχανα ἢ κερχάνεα· ὀστέα, καὶ ῥίζαι 
ὀδόντων (‘stumps’). The horns of Io are 
always a prominent feature in the legend: 
Aesch. Prom. 613 τᾶς βούκερω  παρθένου, 
Prop. 1. 3. 20 ignotis cornibus Inachidos, 
Ov. Met. 1. 652. R. Ellis (Hermath. IX 
153) also defends χελώνης, which he 
understands as a reference to the roughness 
of the tortoise's corrugated and puckered 
skin. But the cow's hide would not have 
been described as κέρχνος, and χελώνης 
must have suggested the shell rather than. 
the skin of the tortoise: cf. Ar. Vesp. 1292.</p>

is an error: see Weir Smyth, Ionic Dialect,
§§ 145, 215. — ἀμεμφείας χἀριν may be
rendered provisionally as ‘meed of ’
although it is equally possible that χάριν
is a preposition. The use of άμεμθείας,
where a word of positive import might
have been expected, is characteristically
Greek. Thus Menelaus, transported with
joy at the recovery of Helen (Eur. Hel.

άντίπλαστον (τῶν) κεκμηκότων = τοῦ

refer to the passage of Inachus under the
earth from Acarnania to Argolis (fr. 271).

ανομ᾿ ἔχει, i.e. ‘has this name (peculiarly)
constructed to signify weariness’ — as if
name were derived from ἶνες and dxos.
In reference to this conjecture it should be
observed that Inachus was traditionally
connected with the proverbial ’Ivovs ἄχη,
a view which is favoured by some modern
authorities (Gruppe, Gr. Myth. p. 134712).
Fick connected the word with the Hesychain
gloss ἰνάσαι· καταχέαι, and χέω,

the root of aqua (cf. Achelous, Acheron):

<p>285 Herodian περὶ μον. λέξ. p. 35, 9
(II Ρ. 940 Lentz) τὰ γὰρ εἰς ρ&#x772;ο&#x772;ς&#x772; δισύλαβα,

edd. give ασχυτρίνων) λάρος εῦτατ᾿ ἐπὶ

τὸ οὐδέτερον, ῾λαρὸν τετυηκοίμεθα δόρπον᾿
(μ 283). βαρυνόμενα δέ, εἰ καὶ ἀρσενικὰ 
ὑπάρχοι ἢ θηλυκά, συστέλλειν θέλει τὸ ᾱ, 
῾λάρῳ ὄρνιθι ἐοικώς᾿ (ε 51).</p>
<p>The puzzle is to extract from this the
words of Sophocles. Dindorf conjectured 
that καὶ σασχυτρίνων was a corruption of 
σατυρικῷ, and this was accepted by Lehrs, 
who altering λαρός after ψαρός to ναρός 
held that λαρός was not introduced until 
the words λάρος ἀνήρ, and converted the 
latter to λαρὸς ἄμης. The intervening 
words λάρος...ἐπὼμοσα form the quotation 
from Sophocles; and were restored by 
Lehrs as ναράς τε πατρὸς κυμάτων ἐπιρροὰς |
ἐπώμοσα. Few will approve Schneider's 
modification (Callint. ΙΙ 756): Ἰὼ δὲ 
ναροῖς εἶτ᾿ κύμασιν ῥοὰς | ἐπώμοσα. 
Both conjectures are a long way from 
the traditional text, but the introduction 
of ναρός (see on fr. 621) is an attractive 
suggestion. H. writes: ‘The proposition 
which Herodian is supporting is that when 
dissyllables in α&#x772;ρ&#x772;ο&#x772;ς&#x772; are accented oxytone, 
the ᾱ is long; whereas, when they are 
paroxytone, the ᾱ is usually short. And 
the Homeric examples bear this out: for 
in the one case the complete line is νήσῳ 
ἐν ἁμφιρύτῃ λαρὸν τετυκοίμεθα δόρπον; 
whereas the complete line in the other 
case is σεύατ᾿ ἔπειτ᾿ ἐπὶ κῦμα λάρῳ ὅρνιθι 
ἐοικώς. Now, if appears to me that the 
latter part of λαροσευτατ᾿ ἐπὶ κῦμα is 
merely a corruption of σεὐατ᾿ ἔπειτ᾿ ἐπὶ 
κῦμα, jotted down by some reader in the 
marginand afterwards transcribed in the 
wrong place. Supposing this to be so, 
we are left with παρά Σοφοκλεῖ ἐν Ἰνάχῳ 
καὶ σασχυτρύνων λαρο . . ἐκροὰς ἐπώμοσα.
The term χυτρῖνοι was applied sometimes 
to pot-like cavities in which springs rise, 
or pot-like holes in rivers; see Hesych. 
s. vv. χυτρῖνοι and λίθων χοαί, Antig. mirab. 
176, Arrian I p. 291 Mueller, which are 
all quoted at full length in the Thesaurus. 
But we cannot read καὶ σὰς χυτρίνων 
ἐκροὰς ἐπώμοσα, because it does not illustrate 
Herodian's point. There was, however,
this word, as well as the adjective 
χύτρινος, to account for a scribe writing 
χύτρίνων by error; and the error would 
be easy if, as I sugest, he found 
ΧΥΓΡΑΙΝωΝ or ΧΥΓΡΥΝωΝ, 
i.e. χ΄ ὑγραίνων or χ΄ ὑγρύνων. My
suggestion is that we have here two fragments,—one, 
ΚΑΙΣΑΡΧΥΓΡΑΙΝωΝ, 
that is, καὶ σάρχ᾿ ὑγραίνων λαρόν (cf. Eur. 
fr. 367), which just meets the case, giving 
both the long ᾱ and the feminine,—and 
another one which does the same, λὰροὺς 
ἐκροὰς ἐπώμοσα. Whether both are from 
the Inachus, or only one, and if so, 
which, I shall not attempt to decide; but
perhaps the first may have been the work 
of a later hand.’ It will be observed 
that this suggestion had been partially 
anticipated by Stadtmueller, who, as 
reported by Egenolff in Rh. Mus. LVI 
288, restored πάσας χυτρίνων ἐκροὰς ἐπώμασεν 
| λαροὺς ἀνἡρ, i.e. omnes foraminum 
exitus clausit vit dulci imbutos sapore, 
and cut out the words, εὔτατ᾿ ἐπὶ κῦμα as 
interpolated from Hom. ε 51. He explained 
χυτρίνων by reference to the underground 
course of the Inachus (fr. 271, 
5). The suggestion that εἴτατ᾿ ἐπὶ κῦμα 
is an interpolation deserves aceptance 
and with it might go λάρος (before εῦτατ᾿). 
λαρὸς ἀνήρ (after ἐπώμοσα) probably has 
nothing to do with Sophocles. If, then, 
following Lehrs, we assume that ναρός has 
dropped out before ἔνθεν θηλυκόν and 
substitute ναράς for καὶ σασ . . ., the result 
is the text, which, however doubtful, 
yields an appropriate sense.</p>

a ludicrous application of the idea: fr.

description by Philostratus of a painting

the reference is to striking with a stick
ot to dancing. Tucker, who takes the
view that έπίκρουμα means reproach,
prefers τῷ ἀργῷ: i.e. Ἄργος is supposed
to be derived from ἀργος ’idle.’ Bergk

<p>The meaning of the words is not
entirely free from doubt owing to the
less of our informal ion respecting
the method of appointing dicasts in the
fifth century. It seems certain, however,
that κυαμοβόλος cannot refer to the voting
of the dicasts, as there it nothing!

ded their votes by using

tome time or other beans were used for
the necessary balloting, as is well known
to have been the case with the κληρωταὶ
ἀρχαί (Gilbert, Staatsalt.2 1 p. 242).
In order to check the increasing evil of
bribery, the method οἱ appointment was
changed from time to time, and we know
little or nothing about the system in vogue
during the middle of the fith century;
thus the evidence οἱ Ar. Plut. 277 as to
balloting for a particular court only affects
the period subsequent to Eurclides,

those who succeeded were afterwards
subdivided into separate panels cannot be
determined (Gilbert, p. 441f.; Lipsius,

of the Greeks: see Eitrem in
Pauly-Wissowa vii 478. In Phil. 391
ἀρεστέρα παμβῶτι Γα, μᾶτερ αὐτοῦ Διός,
her identification with Rhea, who in Hes.
Theog. 470 is her daughter, is implied.
Cf. Chrysipp. II 1084, 1085 Arn. The
introduction into Greece of the Phrygian
cult of Rhea-Cybele, Mother of the Gods,
is assigned to the fifth century: cf. Strabo
῾ πέαν μὲν αὐτοὶ τιμῶσι καὶ ἀργιάξουσι
ταὺτῃ, μηξτέρα καλοῦντες Θεῶν. In Εur.
Hel. 1302 Demeter is called the mother
of the gods, and is clearly, as the sequel
shows, identified with Cybele. On the
other hand, Demeter has many affinities
with Ge: for the evidence see Gruppe,
Gr. Myth. p. 1166. It should be added
that, although the identification of the
Mother of the Gods with Rhea-Cybele
is extremely common, there is reason to
believe that there was also an indigenous
Greek cult, recognized in the title given
to the Metroon at Athens, of a goddess
known simply as μήτηρ θεῶν (Horn. h.
14). But there is nothing to connect her
directly with Ge. Whether Sophocles
here followed the Hesiodic tradition, or,
as in the Philoctetes, meant to describe
Rhea-Cybele, it is impossible to
determine.</p>

the κημός as funnel-shaped

There is some doubt whether the shape
of the κημός was intended to secure
secrecy, since in the fifth century the
voting may have been open: see Starkie
P. 287, and on the other side

<p>ΙΟΒΑΤΗΣ</p>
<p>The famous story of Bellerophon appears first in Horn. Z
155 — 202, where, however, Iobates is not mentioned by name.
Welcker (pp. 416 — 418) identified the plot with part of the
narrative extracted from Asclepiades (FHG 111 303) by the
schol. οn Horn. Z 155 ὁ δὲ TlpolTOS avroyeip μὲν οὺκ έβουλήθη

μοῖράν riva. This is a plausible enough guess, but has no other
foundation than the presumption afforded by the title that the
action of the drama took place in Lycia. When Welcker
proceeds to assume that the play opened with the return of
Bellerophon from the last of his trials, i.e. the λόχος of Z 189, he
is on very insecure ground. Euripides wrote two plays on
the subject, the Stheneboea (TGF p. 567) and the Bellerophon
(ib. p. 443). The scene of the former must have been Tiryns,
and in the latter the attempt to ascend to Olympus and the
subsequent misfortunes of the hero were described. The
adventures in Lycia are related without any variation of
substance by Apollod. 2. 30—33, Hygin. fab. 57, and

<pb n="215"/>
other authorities; but it is worthy of mention that Hyginus
makes the betrothal of Bellerophon to the daughter of Iobates
subsequent to the fall from Pegasus. We are certainly not
compelled to assume that the treatment of Sophocles was so
distinct from that of Euripides as to ignore the ὕβρις of
Bellerophon. which Pindar discreetly veiled in Οl. 13. 91, but
condemned unhesitatingly in Isth. 7. 44 ff.: τὸ δὲ πὰρ δίκαν |

<p>ΙΠΠΟΝΟΥΣ</p>
<p>Hipponous, King of Olenus in Achain1, finding his daughter
Periboea to be with child, sent her across the straits to Oeneus at
Calydon in Aetolia, bearing a secret message that she is to
be made away with. Such was the account of Hesiod (fr. 97 Rz ),
who makes her ravisher Hippostratus son of Amarynceus. It
will be noticed that here Oeneus — apparently as dwelling in
a remote and uncivilized corner of Greece — takes the place
assigned to Nauplius in the stories of Aerope and Auge.
According to others, Oeneus himself was the father of the child
to whom Periboea afterwards gave birth, and Hipponous was
aware of this when he sent his daughter to Calydon (Apollod.
1. 75). The Thebais (fr. 6 K.) simply related that Oeneus sacked
Olenus and took away Periboea as his ykpas. But in Diodorus
(4. 35) Periboea alleges that she is with child by Ares; and her
father sent her to Oeneus to be destroyed. Oeneus, who had
recently lost his wife Althaea and his son Meleager, had not the
heart to kill Periboea, but married her and so became the father
of Tydeus. Yet another variant is indicated by the proverb
Τυδεὺς ἐΚ συφορβίου (Plut. prou. 1. 5 [Paroem. 1 322]), which is
explained by the story that Hipponous handed over his daughter
Periboea, together with her infant child Tydeus, to the custody of
swineherds. It is hardly possible to pick out the version of
Sophocles from this medley ; but Welcker was perhaps right
(p. 428) in conjecturing that Oeneus himself was the father
of the child, and that a recognition occurred in the course of
the play.</p>
<p>There is an important reference to the play in Pollux 4. 111
τραγικὸν δ᾿ οὐΚ ἔστιν (sc. ἡ παρόβασις)· ἀλλ᾿ Εὐριπίδης αὐτὸ
πεποίηκεν ἐν πολλοῖς δράμασιν. ἐν μέν μέν γε τῇ Δανάῃ τὸν χορὸν
τὰς γυναῖκας ὑπὲρ αὑτοῦ τι ποιήσας παρᾴδειν, ἐκλαθόμενος ὡς
ἄνδπρας λέγειν ἐποἰησε τᾠ σχήματι τῆς λἐξεως τὰς γυναῖκας. καὶ
Σοφοκλῆς δ᾿ αὐτὸ ἐΚ τῆς πρὸς ἐκεῖνον ἁμίλλης ποιεῖ σπανιάκες,
ὥσπερ ἐν ῾Ιππόνῳ. Nauck and others have drawn from this
passage the inference that the chorus in the Hipponous consisted
of women, who in a particular passage spoke of themselves in
the masculine gender. But an examination of the context makes
it clear that αὐτὸ ποιεῖ refers back to the opening of the section,
defining Trapdftacris as the occasion when the chorus expressed
the real opinions of the poet.</p>
<p>Pacuvius wrote a play entitled Periboea, but there is no
particular indication that he followed Sophocles.</p>

<p>I suppose these to have been the words
of Periboea on her arrival at Calydon
from her native Olenus. The Aetolian
Olenus is mentioned by Homer (B 639)
together with other Aetolian towns. It
was under Mt Aracynthus in the neighbourhood
of Pleuron, and was destroyed 
by the Aeolians (Strabo 451, 460). On
the other hand Homer did not mention 
the Achaean Olenus (Strabo 386). It 
might be thought that Sophocles would
follow the Homeric geography, and in 
the Thebais (fr. 6 Kinkel), where Oeneus
won Periboea as a prize at the sack of 
Olenus, the Aetolian town was probably 
intended, But the considerations in favour 
of Achaea are much stronger. Not 
only did Hesiod (fr. 97 Rz.) mention Hipponous 
the father of Periboea as sending 
her to Oeneus from his home at Olenus 
in Achaea, but Diodorus (4. 35), who tells 
the story in a form which may well have 
been that of Sophocles, also implies that 
Olenus was in Achaea. It should be 
added that the Achaean Olenus was also 
the scene of an adventure of Heracles, in 
which he avenged an insult offered to the 
daughter of Dexamenus by the centaur 
Eurytion (Pausan. 5. 3. 3, 7. 18. 1, Apollod. 
2. 5. 5.) Bacchylides, however, 
placed the incident in Elis (fr. 48 J.), 
from which the existence of a third Olenus 
has been inferred.—γῆς φορβάδος

<p>ΙΦΙΓΕΝΕΙΑ</p>
<p>The character of the plot is indicated by two of the fragments.
The authorities who quote fr. 305 refer to the betrothal of
Iphigenia to Achilles, making it plain that the progress of the
action was similar to that of the Iphigenia at Aulis of Euripides.
It is also known that Clytaemnestra accompanied her daughter
to Aulis, and that Odysseus was one of those who were privy to

<pb n="219"/>
the plot. The latter circumstance probably shows, as we shall 
see, that Sophocles followed the version of the Cypria more 
closely than Euripides. Welcker (p. 107 ff.) suggests that the 
relations between Odysseus and Achilles were of the same kind 
as the dealing of the former with Neoptolemus in the Philoctetes.
This evidence is confirmed by fr. 308, which  may reasonably be 
referred to the delay of the expedition at Aulis.</p>
<p>The version of the Cypria, according to the epitome of 
Proclus (EGF p. 19), was as follows: καὶ τὸ δεύτερον ἠθροισμένου 
τοῦ στόλου ἐν Αὐλίδι Ἀγαμέμνων ἐπὶ θήρας βαλὼν ἔλαφον 
ὑπερβάλλειν ἔφησε καὶ τὴν Ἄρτεμιν1. μηνίσασα δὲ ἡ θεὸς ἐπέσχεν 
αὐτοὺς τοῦ πλοῦ χειμῶνας ἐπιπέμπουσα· Κάλχαντος δὲ εἰπόντος 
τὴν τῆς θεοῦ μῆνιν καὶ Ἰφνυγένειαν κελεύσαντος θ;θειν τῇ Ἀρτέμιδι, 
ὡς ἐπὶ γάμον αὐτὴν Ἀχιλλεῖ μεταπεμψάμενοι θύειν ἐπιχειροῦσιν· 
Ἄρτεμις δὲ αὐτὴν ἐξαρπάσασα εἰς Ταύρους μετακομίζει καὶ ἀθάνατον 
ποιεῖ, ἔλαφον δὲ ἀντὶ τῆς κόρης παρίστησι τῷ βωμῷ. Apollod. 
epit. 3. 21, 22 reproduces this with hardly any addition, except 
the statement that Odysseus and Talthybius were sent to 
negotiate with Clytaemnestra, with the plea that Iphigenia 
should be given in marriage to Achilles as the price for obtaining 
his participation to have been derived from Sophocles, is exactly 
similar, except that Diomedes takes the place of Talthybius. We 
shall hardly go wrong in inferring that there extracts give us 
a rough outline of the Sophoclean play.</p>
<p>Of the Iphigenia of Aeschylus (TGF p. 31.) hardly anything is 
known. Ennius, in his play bearing this title, is believed to have 
followed Euripides (Ribbeck, p. 94f.); but from a considerable 
fragment quoted by Gellius (N.A. 19. 10. 12) it appears that the 
chorus consisted of Argive warriors. Hence Bergk, followed by 
Welcker, conjectured that this feature was borrowed by Ennius 
from Sophocles. It should be added that the substance of the 
fragment (fr. III otio qui nescit uti plus negoti habet | quam si 
cuist negotiosus animus in negotio) resembles the thought of 
fr. 308; but the coincidence hardly establishes Bergk's inference.</p>
<p>Welcker conjectured that the title Clytaemnestra, known 
to us from a single quotation (fr. 334), was a careless allusion 
to the present play. That is possible; but it is perhaps more 
natural to refer the notice to the Aegisthus,if such a play 
existed (p. 21). The Agamemnon of Aeschylus seems to have 
been regarded as an unapproachable model, and, if Sophocles 
treated the subject at all, he probably reverted to the Homeric 
standpoint.</p>

<p>The significance of the proverb is
similar to Matth. evang. 9. 17 οὐδὲ

fr. 723 (1 566 Κ.), Κώνωψ ἀξηρῷ τερπόμενος

similar reference to a homely proverb in
Aesch. Αg. 334 f. ὄξος Τ᾿ ἄλειφά τ’ έγχέας
ταὺτῷ Κύτει | διχοστατοῦντ᾿ ἄν οὐ φίλω
προσεννέποις. — μελισσοῦθαι is writen
μελιττοῦθαι in the text of the source.
The form has been suspected, since
μελιτοῦσθαι appears elsewhere with this
meaning: Plut. qu. conu. 1. 10. 2
p. 628 D, Democritus enquired the reason
why a cucumber tasted sweet, and the
waiting-woman replied, ἐγὼ γὰρ ἀγνοήσασα
τὸ σἰκυον εὶς ἀγγεῖον ἐθέμην
μεμελιτωμένον. Hence Nauck (Indeex
p. Χἰi) proposed ούχὶ μελιτοῦσθαι. But,
as Sophocles uses μέλισσα in the sense
of μέλι Ο. C. 481), there is no reason
why he should not have adopted μελισσοῦθαι
for μελιτοῦσθαι. The formation
is as legitimate in one case as in the
other (cf. γεφυτοῦσθαι); and the οω
suffix became enormously productive with
causative function (Brugmann, Comp. Gr.
iv p. 297 E. tr.).</p>

Α. Ρ. 9. 10. 3 οὔπω δ᾿ ἦν πέτρῃ ἴκελος

there is a constant appearance of the

quomodo adul. ab am. intern. 8 p. 52 F,

transformations of the polypus passed 
into a proverb (Diogen. 1. 23 πολύποδος 
πολυχρόου νόον ἴσχε, Zeob. 1. 24 
[Paroem. 1 pp. 8, 184]), and were applied 
to the wily man's adaptability to his surroundings 
(τὸ πολύτροπον), either with 
commendation as here and in Theogn.

as in Ion fr. 36 καὶ τὸν πετραῖον

These passages offer abundant evidence 
in support of Reiske's χρῶμα, if they do 
not also, as J. thinks, completely justify 
πρὸς ἀνδρί.Further, I infer that τραπέσθαι 
means ‘to change,’ being followed 
by φρονήματος as an abl. gen. of separation: 
see Theogn. 218 κρέσσων τοι σοφίη 
γίνεται ἀτροπίης. J. however renders: 
‘Be mindful to adapt the hue of your 
real thought to your man, as the polypus 
adapts it to the rock’—but surely his real 
thought is what the πολύτροπος desires to 
conceal from his fellow men.—πρὸς ἀνδρί 
means ‘as you approach another,’ ‘when 
close to him’; for which cf. πρὸς τοῖς 
πολεμίοις εἶναι Thuc. 3. 22, 77, and πρὸς 
αὐτῷ γ᾿ εἰμι τῷ δεινῷ λέγειν O. T. 1169. 
J., whose view is somewhat different, 
compares Ai. 95 ἔβαψας ἔγχος εὖ πρὸς 
Ἀργείων στρατῷ.—πουλύπους: for the 
Ionism see Smyth, Ionic Dialect, § 254,
and Jebb on Ant. 86.—πέτρᾳ might be a 
locative dative (Phil. 144), but it is more 
likely that we should carry on the influence 
of πρός from the main clause. 
Cobet, Var. Lect. p. 163 ff., laid down 
the important distinction that, when the 
clause of comparison precedes, no preposition 
accompanies the noun of the 
main sentence (e.g. Plat. rep. 414 E δεῖ 
ὡς περὶ μητρὸς καὶ τροφοῦ τῆς χώρας 
ἀμύνειν); but that, when the comparison 
follows, the preposition must appear in 
the second clause. He consequently 
emended the fragment of Antiphanes: πρὸς 
γὰρ τὸ γῆρας ὤσπερ ἐργαστήριον | ἄπαντα 
τάνθρώπεια προσφοιτᾷ κακά by writing ὡς 
πρὸς ἐργαστήριον. No doubt the distinction 
is generally observed, but Kock 
(II 116) and Gomperz (Nachl. p. 7) seem 
right in denying its universality.—There 
is no need for violen alterations like 
Blaydes's σοφοῦ πρὸς ἀνδρὸς, or Pflugk's 
δεινοῦ πρὸς ἀνδρὸς γνῶμα πουλύπου τρύτοις |
παρεκτραπέσθαι γνησίου φρονήματος. Porson's 
νοῦν δεῖ makes the structure more 
symmetrical by providing an accusative 
to balance χρῶμα, but introduces the fresh 
awkwardness of leaving χρῶμα to represent 
both νοῦν and φρονήματος, which are 
apparently distinguished. Since τρέπεσθαι 
is used in the required sense as well absolutely 
as with a limiting accusative, it 
may be doubted whether any change is 
necessary. Bergk's σχῆμα (for σῶμα) 
would avoid this particular difficulty.—J. 
thinks that the words were spoken by 
Odysseus, who was the agent of Agamemnon's 
fraud. Bergk, who understood 
ἀνδρί as ‘husband,’ thought that Clytaemnestra was addressing her daughter.</p>

proposing τίκτειν . . . εἰκαία φιλεῖ | σπουδή,
which recalls Seyffert's σπουδῇ βραδύς

and conjectured ἡ λίαν σχολή (misprinted
σφολή). But eixala σχολἠ seems an entirely
suitable phrase to distinguish an
aimless inactivity (cf. Aesch. Ag. 203
πνοαὶ κακόσχολοι, with the schol. ἐπὶ
κακῷ ποιοῦσαι σχολάζειν) from that σχολή
which is the indispensable condition of
true freedom: see Eur. Ion 633 f., Arist.
pol. 4 (7). 15. 1334a 20 κατὸ γὰρ τὴν παροιμίαν,
οὐ σχολὴ δούλοις. The rarity of
εἰκαῖος is probably accidental. Cf. Ar.
Νυb. 44 βίος . . . κἰκῆ κείμενος. Ηense however
thinks that εἰκαία is probably due to
some philosopher (as Chrysippus) who
only approved leisure as the result of
deliberate choice. He quotes Sen. de

Μελάμπους καθάρας τὰς Προιτίδας,
ἤγουν ταῖς Χάριαιν. Σοφοκλῆς᾿ Ἰφιγενείᾳ.</p>
<p>From this obscure but interesting passage
we are justified in inferring that
Sophocles used the word ἀκρουχεῖ for
dwells on the heights, and probably that
Artemis was the subject to the verb.
Her connexion with the plot needs no
remark, and there is sufficient evidence
to prove that her cult was often established
on the summit of a mountain. Hence
Eur. Ι. Τ. 126 ὦ παῖ τᾶς Δατοῦς | Δίκτυνν᾿
οὐρεία, and the similar epithets ὀρειβάτις,
ὀρεσίφοιτος, ὀρεστιάς, ὀρειάς (Gruppe, Gr.
Myth. Ρ. 12843). Ιn Argos she was
worshipped under the title of Ἀκρία:
Hesych. I p. 104 Ἀκρία· . . . ἔστι δὲ καὶ ἡ
Ἥρα καὶ Ἄρτεμις καὶ Ἀφροδίτη προσαγορευομένη
ἐν Ἄργει, κατὰ τὸ ὅμοιον ἐπ᾿
ἄκρῳ ἰδρυμέναι. At Epidaurus she bore
the title Κορυφαία from her sanctuary on
the top of Mt Coryphum (Pausan. 2. 28.
2). Οn the top of Mt Lycone close to
the border of Argos and Arcadia was a
temple of Artemis Orthia (Pausan. 2. 24.
5). On Mt Crathis in Arcadia was a
sanctuary of the Pyronian Artemis, where
a fire of peculiar sanctity was kept
burning (Pausan. 8. 15. 9). She also
had a sanctuary on Mt Artemisius above
Oenoe (Pausan. 2. 25. 3). The rest of
the gloss in Hesych. is a learned aetiological
note intended to explain the origin
of the word ἀκρουχεῖ as applied to Αrtemis.
It is unnecessary to suppose that
there was any allusion to the daughters of
Proetus in the text of Sophocles. The
story of their madness and its healing is
most fully given in Apollod. 2. 24—29.
In the account of Bacchylides (10. 40—
112) there is no reference to Melampus.
Hesych. is the only authority who mentions
the mountain Acrum in connexion
with this story; the scene of their healing
is given either as Sicyon (Apollod., Pausan.
2. 7. 8), the river Anigrus in Elis
(Pausan. 5. 5. 10, Strabo 346), or Lusi
in Arcadia (Bacchyl., Pausan. 8. 18. 8
etc.). The last-mentioned alternative induced 
Jacobs (on Α. Ρ. [append. 420] XI
p. 406) to make the violent and impossible
conjecture ἐν Δουσοῖς ἐν Ἀρκάσιν in
place of the words ἤγουν ταῖς Χάρισιν.
Unger's ἤγουν ταῖς χορείαις (Theb. Parad.
p. 459) rests on Apollod. 2. 29, where
Melampus is said to have cured the Proetides
by the employment of magic dancing
μετ᾿ ἀλαλαγμοῦ καὶ τινος ἐνθέου χορείας).
But the text of Hesych. has been so mutilaed
that the words may very well be
sound, recording an alternative or joint
cult of the Charites established by Melampus 
at the time of the healing. For
the common worship of Artemis and the
Charites see Wernicke in Pauly-Wissowa
II 1363. Wagner wished to substitute
ἀκροῦχε · ἄκρον ἔχουσα, and M. Schmidt,
who observed that the alphabetical order
is slightly disturbed at this point, strangely
suggested Ἄκῤ ὀχεῖ.</p>

<p>In Pind. Nem. 1. 39 ἀλλὰ θεῶν βασίλεα 
(so Schroeder: βασίλεια codd.) the word 
is trisyliabic, however written. The form 
βασίλη is also attested by Steph. Byz.

§ 177, refers to Herodian I 275, 3 
Lentz. Cf. ἱέρεα on Attic inscriptions
(Meisterhans3, p. 40). It is worth mentioning 
that βασίλεια was a title of Artemis 
in Thrace (Hdt. 4. 32); but of course 
there is nothing to show that Sophocles 
used βασίλη as a divine title. For the 
form see also Usener, Götternamen,

<p>Schneider's conjecture. ἸφιΓΕΝείᾳ for

(Boeckh, Welcker, and Hippenstiel) is an 
unlikely title: see Introductory Note to

<p>Apollo, as a μάντις, is the mouthpiece

just been announced from Delphi is addressed 
as ὦ Διὸς ἁδυεπὲς φάτι: cf. ibid.

<p>The three fragments which before 191 1 were alone associated
with this title were not of such a character as to reveal the
subject-matter; and the guess of Welcker that the Trackers
were engaged upon the search for Europa, when she was carried
off by Zeus, and that of Ahrens that they were the prophets
invited by Minos to search for Glaucus remained equally
unverifiable. The obscurity has now been dispelled by the
discovery, among the documents which have been recovered
from the dust-heaps of Oxyrhynchus, of a large portion of a
papyrus roll which contained the Ichnentae. The constituent
fragments of the roll were successfully fitted together by
Prof. A. S. Hunt, and in the result he was able to publish in
vol. IX of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (no. 1174 at Ρ. 30 ff.) the more
or less complete remains of fifteen successive columns starting
from the opening of the play and containing about 400 lines,
some two-thirds of which are substantially intact. A number of
smaller fragments which could not be located1 adds little or
nothing to the sum of our knowledge.</p>
<p>The MS, which is carefully written, is assigned to the closing
decades of the second century A.D. A number of corrections,
including marks of punctuation, has been added by a second
hand, and various readings recorded in the margin proceed from
the same source. These variants are sometimes quoted from
specified authorities — particularly from the edition of Theon2;
besides him, Aristophanes3 and possibly Nicander4 (or Nicanor)
are cited. Another notable feature is the appearance of stichometric
figures, giving the numeration of each hundredth line,
which however do not agree exactly with the requirements
of the text. From these circumstances it may be inferred that
we have a critically revised text descended from a grammarian's
copy. The MS is a less elaborate example of the type which is
characteristically represented by the papyrus containing the
Paeans of Pindar (Ox. Pap. v, no. 841).</p>

<p>The subject of the play proves to be identical with that
of the Homeric hymn to Hermes, although the development
of the story proceeds upon somewhat different lines The play
ojxmis with the appearance of Apollo, who relates the loss of his
cattle and describes his hitherto unsuccessful attempts to discover
the thief during his progress from Northern Greece to Mt Cyllene
in Arcadia. He accordingly issues a proclamation to all whom
it may concern, promising a definite reward to anyone who shall
enable him to recover his property. Silenus enters in answer to
immons, and offers the assistance of his sons the satyrs,
but stipulates that a reward of gold shall be paid over, and that
id his sons shall be released from slavery. Apollo leaves
the chorus of satyrs advances. They are ready
at once to start in pursuit, and Silenus in a short speech invokes
divine and human aid. Then the chorus, bending on all-fours
and imitating the actions of keen-scented hounds, discover the
confu ks of cattle pointing in different directions. But
before the quarry can be run to earth, the pursuers are alarmed
strange sound entirely unlike to any which they have
1 to known1. It seems to issue from the cave towards which
base has brought them. Silenus upbraids them for their
irdice, and contrasts their degenerate attitude with his own
ngtiished bravery in the days of old. The hunt is then
ed. and Silenus undertakes to support and protect his
children by accompanying them to the point of danger. The
e noise is again heard, and for a second time the ardour of
pursuit is damped. Hut the actual issue of the combined
nndertaking is not altogether clear. I have ὁ that
Silenus, just nou bo valiant, proves himself rather more of a
coward than his follower and by refu continue the
nture and abruptly leaving the stage, abandons the chorus
fate. However this may be, it seems certain that M
qiu ntlv the coryphaeus assumed the position previously occupied

tbable that afterwards reappeared, or, if he was
it throughout, resumed the prominence which he had
temporarily abandoned.</p>
<p>After noisy but ineffectual efforts by the chorus to accomplish
their task, the situation is suddenly changed by the arrival of

the glens has been disturbed by their shouts, and the hue and
cry raised for the arrest of a thief. The chorus replies in humble
tones, and asks for an explanation of the marvellous sound which
comes echoing from the upland hollows. Cyllene, somewhat
mollified, would have preferred to know their business first; but
finally, after warning them of the serious consequences which
would follow a disclosure of the secret to others, she consents to
explain what has astonished them. Zeus, it appears, having
secretly visited the daughter of Atlas without the knowledge
of Hera, had begotten a son by her. During the ’s illness,
Cyllene has been nursing the newly-born infant. But he proved
to be no ordinary child; for, though born less than a week ago,
his growth has been so rapid that he has already passed from
childhood to maturity. As his ’s command required that
he should be kept concealed within the cave, he had occupied
his time with the construction from a dead beast of a mysterious
toy, which produces the strange melodies now in question. In
answer to further requests for an explanation of the riddle,
Cyllene describes the making of the lyre from the shell of the
tortoise. There are some serious gaps in the papyrus at this
point, but, since the chorus immediately proceeds to denounce
the divine child as the thief of whom they are in search, it is
clear that Cyllene must have referred to the ox-hide which had
been stretched over the shell. She waxes indignant at their
audacity: to charge the son of such parents with larceny is
a monstrous piece of insolence, which betrays the childish
ineptitude of the accusers. Let them beware lest their foolish
gibes are not exchanged for cries of pain. Nevertheless, the
satyrs persist, and apparently challenge Cyllene to produce the
cows, so that their identity may be established.</p>
<p>Here unfortunately the papyrus ends, and we can only guess
at the sequel. It is certain that Apollo returned, and that
in consequence of the recovery of the cattle he rewarded Silenus
according to his promise. The reconciliation with Hermes must
have followed, and no doubt the gift of the lyre placated Apollo
for the outrage which had been committed against his property.</p>
<p>Such is the story of the play so far as we are permitted
to trace it, and it is apparent that it differs in several respects
from the Homeric version, (i) The theft of the cows here
precedes, but in Homer follows the invention of the lyre.
(2) The cows are concealed on Mt Cyllene itself and not in the
neighbourhood of Triphylian Pylos. (3) Cyllene1 and not Maia
has charge of the infant. (4) The informer, to whom later writers
gave the name of Battus, is displaced by the satyrs, — an essential

modification in view of the dramatic requirements. We know
little or nothing of the intermediate literature1, and, so far as
we can tell, the only innovation for which Sophocles was
responsible may have been the introduction of the satyrs, The
details of the cattle-stealing are less complex than in the hymn,
and the choice of Mt Cyllene as the hiding-place of the herd
is at least as likely to have been a reversion to the primitive
legend as a necessary outcome of the dramatic situation2.
ApollodortlS in the mythographical handbook (3. 112 flf.) follows
generally the narrative of the hymn; but, though he differs
widely from Sophocles, he nevertheless agrees with him in making
the theft of the cattle prior to the invention of the lyre, and also
connecting the two incidents together as part of the same
tion. According to Apollodorus, Hermes made strings for
his lyre from the guts of the slain cattle; we cannot say whether
this point was mentioned by Sophocles, but he certainly alluded
to the skins of the cows having been used in the construction of
part of the instrument (307 n., 337, 366). The latter
a reminiscence of the hymn3; but the ox-hide
mentioned did not belong to ’s cattle, which Hermes
had not yet stolen, Similarly, the hymn-writer, as contrasted
with Apollodorus, mentions sheep-gut as the material out of
which Hermes fashioned the strings. Although Apollodorus
iuch in common with the hymn, it it idle to suppose that be
OUrce, and that his deviations from it were tin
fruit of his own invention4.</p>
<p>The most striking result of the comparison of Sophocles with
the hymn is the combination by the former of two di
achievem that the invention of the lyre not only provides
neans of appeasing the indignatioa of Apollo, but also
appears to have been directly prompted by the theft of the cows.

which involved an alteration in the order of the events described
in the hymn, was the deliberate invention of conscious art, than
that popular tradition had always combined what the hymn-
writer chose from a motive not easily discernible to separate1.
Both in method and in spirit the treatment of Sophocles is
far removed from the work of the hymn-writer, but the extent of
the debt which the tragedian must have acknowledged cannot
be accurately measured owing to the loss of the second half
of the play. It would have been particularly illuminating to
discover what were the Attic traits added by Sophocles to the
portrait of Hermes, whose precocious trickery is so cleverly
delineated in the hymn. There are enough resemblances in
detail to show that Sophocles was well acquainted with the
Homeric text, as may be seen from the following instances:

<p>The other literary allusions to the story need not detain
us long. Philostratus (imag. 1. 25, entitled ῾ Ερμοῦ γοναί) makes
Olympus the birthplace, and except in one small detail2 is
entirely remote from Sophocles. Antoninus Liberalise (23)
relates the story of Battus for the purpose of recording the
punishment inflicted upon him for his treachery; the theft of the
cows was of secondary importance to him, and the only part
of his narrative which concerns us is the itinerary of the cattle-
drive, which may be used to illustrate tlie mutilated lines
following v. 13. Ovid (Met. 2. 676-707) confines himself even
more strictly to the subject of the transformation of Battus. The
anonymous scholiast on Antoninus, who drew his information
from the Δειμών of Pamphilus, prefaces this chapter with the

in the original form of the hymn, and that signs of the inconsistency thereby
produced are still visible. See also Herwerden, Mum. xxxv 181 ff., Kuiper, iff.

citation of several authorities who had previously written on the
subject. Nicander, Didymarchus, Antigonus, and Apollonius
Khodius belong to a later age; and it is improbable that ’s
(fr. 153 Rz.) had any bearing upon the subsequent treatment
of Sophocles. The gift of the κηρύκειον by Apollo to
Hermes is indicated in the hymn (529) and expressly recorded
ter authorities1. If the tradition was known to Sophocles,
ms unlikely that he would pass it over in silence.</p>
<p>However interesting the discovery of the new fragments may
be, they will scarcely enhance the reputation of the poet. The
dramatic value of the play is insignificant, and the comic relief
not greatly exhilarating. It is fair to admit that the more
ing scenes probably occurred in the latter part of the play,
when Hermes displayed his cunning and his wit in tricking and
conciliating his acuser2. Hut the part which is preserved is less
and entertaining than the Cyclops, which has hitherto been
(??)mple of the satyric drama. Vet, although it is
isible to rate highly the importance of the play as we
know it, we must beware of pronouncing a final judgment on
what is actually a torso, more particularly as the recovered
lent has merits of its own which may be pleaded in miti-
gation of an adverse verdict. Chief among these are direct
of purpose and clearness of outline, which, allied in general to
a plainness of diction suitable to the simplicity of the action3,
an impression of natural grace and exhibit in a less familiar
h specimen of Attic versatility.</p>

freedom in the metre of the iambics: Porson's canon is violated
in 333, as against several more serious infringemnts in the
Cyclops; and whereas eighteen instances of the licence admitting
the introduction of the anapaest into other feet than the first
have been counted in the Cyclops1, there is only one — and that
doubtful — in the Ichnentae (122). It is rather in the nature
of the thoughts expressed than in respect to vocabulary or
structure that the style deviates from the normal character of
Sophoclean tragedy.</p>
<p>The appearance of fr. 294 N.2 as v. 275 f. is conclusive evidence
on the question of authorship. Wilamowitz specifies as marks
of Sophoclean origin the use of okfMCpiv in 210, of ἀπονοσφίξω in
131, and of evSetv in 159; and to these should at least be added
vecoprjs in 1 50, and fiovvov in 49. General impressions are less to
be trusted, but I think that few will hesitate on consideration to
acquiesce in the judgment of Wilamowitz, that the play reflects
Sophocles' earlier manner, and that the occasional harshness and
want of polish must be set down to to ttlkpov koX Karateyyov
which he himself recognized as a blemish of immaturity2. Some
might go further and contend that there is here and there a
tendency towards bombast which shows that he has not yet
shaken himself free from the influence of Aeschylean ὄγκος; and
it will be readily admitted that the harmonious blend of mellow-
ness and lucidity to which he ultimately attained is hardly
perceptible in these fragments. But Wilamowitz finds unmis-
takable signs of an early date in certain definite peculiarities
of technique; that is to say, (1) there is no occasion for the
presence of three actors on the stage at the same time; (2) no
verse of the dialogue is broken between two speakers3; (3) the
absence of strophic responsion from the opening chorus is
comparable with similar features in the Septan and the Eumenides;
(4) the alternation of lyrics with ordinary dialogue and stichomythia
in the scene between Cyllene and the chorus finds
its nearest parallel in the ultimately successful attempts of Athena
to placate the Eumenides in the Aeschylean play4.</p>
<p>It may be remarked in passing that the date of the Cyclops is

<note type="footnote">4 If it is rightly inferred from Pacuvius (293 n.) that Euripides imitated this play
in the Antiope, that circumstance would not assist the determination of the date,
since it is certain that the Antiope was one of the latest plays (perhaps 408: Dieterich
in Pauly-Wissowa vi 1266). Equally inconclusive is the argument which Wilamowitz
deduces from the statement that Sophocles himself played the lyre in the Thamyras
(p. 178), namely, that Sophocles took the part of Hermes, and that consequently the
play must have belonged to his youth. Robert prefers to suppose for similar reasons
that the poet represented Apollo.</note>

quite uncertain, and has been fixed by some critics earlier than
4381. If that view were correct, the date of the Ichneutae would
be put still further back ; for the priority of the latter play is
assured, apart from general considerations pointing the same
way, by the freedom exercised by Euripides both in the division
of his lines between two speakers, and in the employment οf
three actors during the same scene.</p>
<p>The action takes place on the barren slopes of Mt Cyllene,
and the entrance to the cave of Maia was the central point
to which the attention of the spectators was directed. Robert2
has suggested that, since the early part of the play seems to
indicate that no hut or cave was visible amid the mountain
solitudes, Cyllene must be suppοsed to have suddenly appeared
from an underground cavern2 by means οf the stage device
known as Χαρώνιοι κλίμακες. The same critic holds that there
was no back-scene, and that the πάγος was represented in the
middle of the orchestra, as is supposed to have been the case
with the Supplices of Aeschylus. But the scene of satyr-plays
tor obvious reasons not infrequently located in the open
country, and nothing is discernible with regard to the scenery of
the Ichneutae which either supports or tells against the hypothesis
of an early date.</p>
<p>From the technical point of view the discovery of a dialogue
of some length composed in iambic tetrameter acatalectic metre
(291 ff.) is remarkable. Nothing of the same kind is found
elsewhere in Greek drama, but the iambic octonarii of Roman
comedy furnish an exact parallel. In both cases the diaeresis at
the end of the first dimeter is sometimes observed and sometimes
neglected; the former type is the more frequent in Plautus, the
latter in Terence. It is worthy of notice that both varieties
occur in the Greek lyric fragments: contrast Alcm. fr. 9 with
Alcae. fr. 56.</p>
<p>It is convenient at this point to call attention to an obscurity
in the story of the play which awaits explanation. Part of
the reward promised by Apollo to Silenus and the satyrs was
the restoration of their freedom (57, 158), and it appears that
in the sequel the promise was fulfilled (445). What then was
the nature of their slavery? Wilamowitz4 refers in this connexion
to the obscure passage (218 ff.) in which Cyllene mentions their
master as formerly wont to follow in the train of Dionysus,
wearing the fawn-skin and wielding the thyrsus. He declines
to guess at his identity, but conjectures that is was disclosed

<pb n="232"/>
on the occasion when the slaves were liberated. Nevertheless, he
candidly admits that the audience do not seem to have required
any explanation to be given concerning the slavery in question.
Now it is true that, as in the Cylops of Euripides, it was not
uncommon for dramatic purposes to represent the satyrs as
in the thrall of some ogre or demonic being, and it was obviously
a useful expedient to account for their presence a the scene
of action. Examples of such bondage are mentioned in the
Introductory Notes to the Amycus, the Heracles at Taenarum.
the Cedalion, and the Pandora. But it is scarcely credible that
this kind of durance would have been employed as an element
of the plot without a single word of explanation. Apollo
expects to find the satyrs among the inhabitants of the coun-
tryside (35), and their slavery is apparently assumed as a
matter of course. In such circumstances the natural inference
would be that the satyrs here as elsewhere (Cycl. 709)
are the slaves of Dionysus. This is the inference which
Robert actually adopts; and he is obliged in consequence
to assume that a line has been lost after 220. The hypothesis
also involves the necessity of explaining why Silenus and the
satyrs desired to be released from the joyous service of Dionysus.
Robert recognizes the difficulty, and meets it by suggesting that
the liberation of the chorus was a constant element in the
denouement of a satyr-play, and that, by an encroachment of the
actual conditions of stage-management upon the story of the
events enacted on the stage, the chorus were released at the end
of the ’s acting, i.e. after the production of the satyr-play,
from their engagement to the Choregus or the Archon. That is
the πόνος from which Silenus and the satyrs are here set free.
In course of time, he thinks, the device staled, or the public
became too fastidious to be satisfied with it; but, in order to
sustain the custom, a mythological servitude (as in the Cyclops)
was invented for each occasion. Whether this bold guess will
meet with general acceptance, time will show; but it is by
no means free from objection. One might be willing not to
lay stress upon the fact that, if the text of 218 ff. is sound,
the δεσπότη is distinguished from the god, but it is surely
pertinent to enquire how Apollo could have promised to set free
the bondsmen of Dionysus. He had received, so far as we know,
no commission to that end, and it is idle to think of him as using
his influence, unless indeed he represented Dionysus in some
fuller sense than is usually recognized. But the relations of the
satyrs with Apollo rather suggest that he himself is the master to
whom their obedience must be rendered. Nor would it be
altogether surprising that among the wooded hills of Arcadia

<pb n="233"/>
the satyrs should temporarily transfer their allegiance from
the wine-god to the huntsman’s patron deity1. We need not
dwell on the fact that Apollo Nomios, the protector οf flocks and
herds, was known in Arcadia as the son of Silenus2, except
as evidence that in his rural aspect he did not disdain an
association with the satyrs. That the satyrs should, at the
bidding of the Hunter, assume the functions of keen-scented
hounds2, is in accordance with their constant fellowship with the
huntsman Pan, as well as with their own proclivities4. None the
less might they be expected to welcome the prospect of release
from the obligation οf service, which is held out as the reward of
success on the present occasion5. Lastly, it may be observed
that the subjection to Apollo is not necessarily inconsistent with
the devotion which they owe to Dionysus. Besides the numerous
points of contact between their worship6, the gods themselves
are identified by Euripides in the Licymnius (fr. 477): δέσποτα
φιλόδαφνε Βάκχε, παιὰν Ἄπολλον εὔλυρε. And, if we are
prepared to admit that Apollo was the δεσπότης of v. 218, it
is not incredible that the god whom Aeschylus (fr. 341)
addressed as ὁ κισσεὺς Ἀπόλλων, ὁ Βακχεύς, ὁ μάντις, should
wear the fawn-skin and wield the thyrsus at the head of the
other members of the Bacchic rout7.</p>

καὶ πᾶσιν as the opening words of Apollo's
speech, comparing vv. 10 and 14: somewhat
less abrupt would be ἀκούετ᾿ ἤδη·
πᾶσιω. But since the conditions seem to
demand that the new clause, of which
ὐπισχνοῦμαι is the principal verb, should
commence at the beginning of v. 2 (τῷ τ᾿
ἐξιχνεντῇ Mekler). it is more likely that
the object of ἀγγέλλω (καινὸν μῶθον or
the like) found its place in v. 1. The
opening of the Alcestis shows that it is
not necessary to suppose that the name
of Apollo appeared in v. 3, and ἀπόπροθεν
rather requires some such supplement
as Mekler's χρυσᾶ κλαπεισῶν μοι

in the ed. pr., supplies τόδ᾿ ἔργον
ἠδὲ δ. in 2, and εῖτ᾿ ἐγγύθεν τις εῖδεν εἴτ᾿
in 3. But the result is unsatisfactory.
It is not absolutely certain that v. 1 was
the first of the play (see cr. n. on v. 94);
but Hunt gives good reasons for considering
it probable.</p>

Eur. Hel. 1619. In Lys. 31. 1 ἄν clearly
goes with the infinitive; and O. C. 748,
Antiph. 3 γ 1, ιδ. 5. 59, Thuc. 8. 66, Xen.
mem. 3. 4. 7, Dem. 9. 68, Plat. Theaet.
114 A, as well as Eur. her 1355, seem to
require a similar explanation. But I
would again put forward the suggestion
that in such cases the influence of ἄν
may extend to both verbs; and this must
be so in Plat. rep. 443E εἰ δέοι ἡμᾶς
ἀνομολογεῖσθαι...τίν ἄν οἴει οἱηθῆναι τοῦτο
αὐτὸν δρᾶσαι; and in Xen. mem. 1. 5. 1,
unless we are prepared to admit that
οἴομαι may be followed by an aorist infinitive representing future time.</p>
<p>11 τόλμαν: see cr. n. The evidence
of our MSS is strongly in favour of the
forms τόλμα and τόλμαν in tragedy, and
they are confirmed by metre. On the
other hand τόλμην is unsupported, although
it was recognized by Phrynichus
(p. 114, 20 de B.=Bekk. anecd. p. 66,
23).—πεσεῖν. The nearest parallel in
Sophocles is Trach. 705 ὤστ᾿ οὐκ ἔχω
τάλαινα ποῖ γνώμης πέσω. Euripides
uses πεσεῖν ἐς c. acc. more freely, generally
as a periphrasis expressing somewhat
more forcibly what might have been
rendered by the aor. inf. of the verb
corresponding to the abstract noun (τολμῆσαι,
ἐρασθῆναι, etc.). So εἰς ἔρωτα
πίπτειν (=῾to fall in love᾿) Eur. fr. 138,
and c. gen. I. T. 1172, Bacch. 812; ἐς
φόβον πεσόντε Phoen. 69; εἰς ἔριν πίπτειν
fr. 578. Occasionally it may be held that
πεσεῖν retains the sense of to hield or give
way, as in Eur. El. 982 εἰς ἀνανδρίαν
πεσεῖν or Or. 696 εἰς ὀργὴν πεσεῖν (contrast
Tr. fr. adesp. 80).</p>

<p>Anton. Lib. 23, after making Hermes
pass through Boeotia (v. 22) and Megaris,
brings him directly to the Peloponnese
by way of Corinth. For the adjective
cf. O. C. 695 ἐν τᾷ μεγάλᾳ Δωρίδι νάσῳ
Πέλοπος. The schol. on O. T. 775 interprets
Δωρίς as Πελοποννησιακή.</p>
<p>30 Mekler Plausibly suggests ξὺν
τάχει.</p>
<p>32 f. Wilamowitz was scarcely justified
in altering ἐσ to εἰ: εἰ δ᾿ ὑληβάτης
ἐνταῦθα ποιμήν. Unless, however, δ᾿ is
an error for θ᾿, which the marginal comment (cr. n.) by no means proves, a new
sentence must begin here, which it is not
easy to adjust agreeably with the context.
Some case or compound of ὕλη seems
inevitable, but would require a qualification.
There does not seem to be enough
room in 33 for ἐσ δ᾿ ὕλην μολὼν | τήνδ᾿
εἴτε κτἑ.—It is unnecessary to omit the
σ of ἀγρωστήρων, although there is no
other example of the form. For ἀγρώστης:
ἀγρώτης see on fr. 94.</p>
<p>34 μαριλοκαυτῶν, a brilliant conjecture
of Wilamowitz from fr. 1067.—
ἐν λόγῳ παρίσταται, ‘is at hand to hear
my words,’ supports the soundness of the 
MS reading in Phil. 319 τοῖσδε μάρτυς ἐν
λόγιος, which has been the object of some
suspicion.</p>
<p>35 νυμφογεννήτου. For the relationship
between nymphs and satyrs see
Hes. fr. 44 Rz. ἐξ ὧν (sc. the daughters
of Hekateros [?] and the daughter of
Phoroneus) οὔρειαι Νύμφαι θετύρων καὶ
νοντο, | καὶ γένος οὐτιδανῶν Σατύρων καὶ
ἀμηχανοεργῶν. Here satyrs and nymphs
are children of the same parents, but the
anonymous satyr-play published in Ox.
Par. VIII 63 (fr. 1, 7) agrees with the
present passage, describing the satyrs as
παῖδες δὲ νυμφῶν, Βακχίου δ᾿ ὑπηρέται.
Silenus, the lover of the nymphs (inf.
149). is their father. Yet satyrs are
sometimes themselves joined in wedlock
with nymphs (Ov. Fast. 3. 409); while
the Sileni are children of the Naiads
(Xen. symp. 5. 7). In Nonn. 14. 113
the satyrs are the sons of Hermes and
iphthime, the daughter of Dorus, See
further on 218 ff.</p>
<p>37 The obvious supplement τὸν φῶρα
does not fit τοῦ Παιῶνος, and Wilamowitz
substituted τῶν for τοῦ in consequence.
But it is not satisfactory to alter the text
in order to justify even so plausible a
restoration of the lost letters. hunt
suggests τὰ δῶρα...ἄρνυται as an alternative,
but admits that τὰ δῶρα scarcely
fills the gap. It is perhaps possible that
θἅλωρα (written τὰ ἔλωρα) might stand
here: cf. Hom. Σ 93.—Παιών as well as
παιάν (O. T. 154) is a familiar ἐπίκλησις
of Apollo: for an attempt to conect it
with Paeonia see C. R. XXVI 249. It is
worth remarking that Usener (Götternamen,
p. 154) found in Sophocles the
earliest identification of Paion and Apollo.
But it is curious that Apollo should refer
to himself by this title, especially as the
circumstanecs have no connexion with
his functions as the Healer.</p>
<p>38 τῷδ᾿ αὐτόχρημα was restored by
Hunt, but αὐτόχρημα does not mean
‘forthwith,’ and is not obviously appropriate
to the context. For its special use
to mark a pun (like ἐτύμως etc.) see Neil
on Ar. Eq. 78. Probably then we should
recognize another instance of τὸ χρῆμα,
used vaguely as in 44 and 136, and preceded
by a participle such as ἀνύσας or
even εὑρών.</p>

<p>39 ἔα· τά. I have accepted Mekler’s
supplement (see cr. n.), since ὦ φοῖβε of

not required so shortly before 42, For
the unusual position of the prononn see
Kuehner-Gerth § 464, 4 anm. 2.</p>
<p>41 σπουδῇ with its relative clause
belongs to ἐπεσσύθην, and the hyperbaton
of τάδε, which of course goes with μαθών,
need cause no difficulty. There is a
similar case in O. T. 1251 χῶπως μἐν
ἐκ τῶνδ᾿ οὐκέτ᾿ οἶδ᾿ ἀπόλλυται: see also
on Eur. Hel. 719.</p>
<p>44 κυνηγίσω: cf. 75 ἐκκυνηγέσαι. If
these forms come from κυνηγεῖν, a verb
not found in any text carlier than Aristotle, the short vowel is very remarkable,
and they msut be added to the list which
contains αἰνίσω, καλέσω, ποθέσω, πονέσω
and others. Several of these are usually
explained as analogical products (ἐκάλεσα:
ἐτελεσα): see Weir Smyth, Ionic Dialect,
p. 489 ff., Brugmann, Comp. Gr. IV pp.
296, 380. Another suggestion, however,
has been put forward by P. Maas
(B. ph. W. 1912, 1075) on the strength
of two statements by grammarians, which
Lobeck (paralip. p. 438) refused to credit.
See Phryn. pracp. soph. p. 84, 1 de B.
κυνηγεττεῖν (rightly, as it now secms,
corrected to κυνηγέττειν by Buttmann)·
διὰ δυοῖν τ&#x772;τ&#x772;
 λέγουσιν. Thcognost. ap.
 Cram. anced. Ox. 11 p. 143, 20 τὰ διὰ
 τοῦ ε&#x772;σ&#x772;σ&#x772;ω&#x772; ῥήματα, πυρέσσω, ἐρέσσω, ἀηθἐσσω,
 κυνηγέσσω. Maas points out the
 exact parallelism between ἑρέσαι (Hom.
 μ 444): ἐρέτης, εἰρεσίη : ἐρέσσειν and
 κυνηγέσαι: κυνηγίτης, κυνηγέσιον: κυνηγίσσειν.
 We must, therefore, conclude
 that Sophocles employed the older κυνηγέσσειν
 as well as the newer formation
 κυνηγετεῖν (Ai. 5), which in its turn gave
 way to κυνηγιῖν.</p>
 <p>45 ff. The sequence of though appears to be, ‘I am ready to assist; for
 I expect my services to be well rewarded.
 And my sons shall aid..., if only you will
 keep your promise.’ the speaker's object
 is to bring Apollo to business. In this
 sense I have endeavoured to restore 45 f.;
 τὸ γὰρ γέρας was admitted by Hunt to be
 a possible reading, but was rejected as
 unsuitable. For the palaeographical details
 his note must be consulted. 47 f. are a 
 puzzling problem: if the elision mark in
 48 is rightly deciphered, as optative (e.g.
 στείλαιμ᾿ ἄν) is possible,—’ Above all,
 your behests must be enlarged by the
 secure reward for me of a golden crown.’
 κείμενον: the word must be understood
 as in Ant. 485 εί ταῦτ᾿ ἀνατὶ τῇδε κείσεται
 κράτη (Jebb's n.). The prize was fixed
 or secured for the winner: Pind. Isth. 1.
 26 ἀλλ᾿ ἐφ᾿ ἐκάστῳ ἔργματι κεῖτο τέλος.
 where τέλος is equinalent to γέρας here.
 The text of the Ms χρ[.] .[..]τεφε (and
 the possibility that another letter follows)
 perhaps represents an original χρυσεοστεφές,
 as χρυσεοστεφάνων appears in
 some MSS of Pind. Ol. 8. 1. In that
 passage χρυσο- is figurative, i.e. it expresses
 the supreme worth of the not
 intrinsically valuable prizes. Here χρυσο-
 is literal, and the second member of the
 compound figurative: the satyrs looked
 for some reward more solid than a wreath.
 The ironical appliecation of the compound
 is well suited to the tone of the passage:
 cf. 72, 156, 202.—ἐπ᾿ ἐντολαῖσι is also
 possible: cf. Trach. 1253.</p>

<p>70ff. Taking the text as it stnds,
I would interpret as follows: ‘Now that
our god has displayed splendid prizes of
gold, let him therewithal at our side
conclude our labours.’ The gold is
secure,—a first favour; next, let the
ques be short. I write ξὑν ἄμα (rather
than συνάμα, which belongs to the Hellenistic age)
as the rough breathing of
the papyrus seems to indicate, although
it might, of course, be an instance of
medial aspiration (fr. 582 n.). ξύν is
then adverbial, as elsewhere in Sophocles
(Ant. 85 etc.); and ἄμα accompanies the
participial clause, as in Xen. anab. 3. 1.
47 καὶ ἄμα ταθτ᾿ εἰπὼν ἀνέστη and other
examples quoted by Kuehner-Gerth 11
82.—άρίζηλα, used in the larger sense
of what is not merely clear, but conspicuous
or striking. θανμαστὴ ἄγνα is
Hesych.'s gloss on ἀριζήλη (1 p. 280),
perhaps in reference to Hom. Σ 319.
ἄριζήλωτος shows that the word was
influenced by ζῆλος, although etymologically
distinct from it. L. and S.'s
account is defective.—παραδείγματα,
here simply things shown, exhibits.
Strictly, we must distinguish the derived
meanings (1) examplc, as in O. T. 1193,
and (2) sample, as in Ar. Pac, 65,</p>
<p>73 Τύχη is personified as in O. T.
1080 ἐγὼ δ᾿ ἐμαντὸν παῖδα τῆς τύχης
νέμων | τῆς εὖ διδούσης. Fortune is not
here invoked as blind chance contrasted
with foresight, although the first beginnings
of that sense are to be found
in Attic poetry (O. t. 977, Ant. 1158).
Rather, she is the divine power to which
all human action is subservient, daughter
of Prometheia, as Alcman calls her (fr.
62), mightiest of the fates according to
Pindar (fr. 41). Cf. Tr. fr. adesp. 506
πάντων τύραννος ἡ τύχη ’στι τῶν θεῶν
κτὲ. Thus the vague δαῖμον ἰθυν τήριε
should not be understood as referring to
Apollo, but as a further description of
the same guiding force. Cf. Dio Chrys.
63. 7 οἱ δὲ πηδάλιον ἔδωκαν κρατεῖν (sc. τῇ
τύχῃ)....τὸ δὲ πηδάλιον δηλοῖ ὅτι κυβερνᾷ
τὸν τῶν ἀνθρώπων βίον ἡ τύχη. id. 64. 5.
Observe also that the worship of ἀγαθὸς
δαίμων was intimately associated at Athens
with that of ἀγαθὴ τύχη: see Gruppe, Gr.
Myth. p. 1088, J. E. Harrison, Themis,
p. 278, and cf. Pausan, 9. 39. 5.—For the
marginal variant see cr. n. I believe
that Aristophanes wrote εύθυντήριε rather
than εἰθυντήριε, as restored in the ed. pr.
For the constant confusion of εὐθύνω and
ἰθύνω and of their congnates, see Eur.

Aesch. fr. 200) have inclined to restore
the forms in εύ.</p>
<p>74 τυχεῖν: for the exclamatory infinitive
in prayers see Goodw. § 785,
Kuchner-Gerth 11 19 ff., Tucker on
Aesch. Theb. 239.—οὖ: the genitive expresses
the object at which an aim is
directed or towards which desire moves.

75 λείαν κατὲ. The asyndeton is no
doubt intended to emphasize the climax
(Kuehner-Gerth 11 341). — It may be
questioned whether αύλησιν is here concret
crete, or whether XeLav and dypav are to
be taken, as is quite possible, as nomina
actionis. On the whole, the idea of disconvering
the stolen cattle seems to be
more prominent than that of punishing
the theft. In fact, an abstract noun is
sometimes employed, where we should
require a concrete: see on Eur. Hel. 50
1675.</p>
<p>77 twv is demonstrative. Cf. 0. T.
200 τόν . . . ὑπὸ σῷ φθίσον κεραυνῷ.</p>
<p>78 φράσας (see cr. n.) seems to be
a necessary correction.</p>
<p>79 προστελής (see cr. n.) does not
occur elsewhere, and has no obvious
meaning. It seems probable, therefore,
that the preposition has been copied by
mistake from the previous line. Hunt
substitutes συνελής, ’contributory,’ which
may well be right, unless we should prefer
the more complimentary πανελής
‘all-effective'). It may be observed
that Aeschylus and Sophocles (if we include
v. 13) each use the word παντελής
four times, but it is never employed by
Euripides or by Pindar.</p>
<p>80f. The purport of these lines was
to promise the informer a share of the
reward.</p>
<p>85 f. are well restored by Hunt: θησίν
τις, ἤ ούδείς σησιν εἰδέναι τάδε; | ἔοικεν ἤδη

Eur. Ι. Τ. 1072.</p>
<p>87 a-y tla supports the reading of
the mss in Ar. Ran. 394, where several
editors adopt Bentley's ἀλλ' εἶα, as well
as ’s reading in Plut. 316. — For the
aspiration, which is said to be Attic, see
schol. A on Horn. I 262 τῆς δασείας ᾿ Αττικῶς

4.</p>
<p>89 αὔρας, evidently with the meaning
scent. Cf. Antiph. fr. 217, 22 (11 105 K.)
ξανθαῖσιν αὔραις σῶμα πᾶν ἀγάλλεται, i.e.
with the savour of roasting.</p>
<p>90 διπλοῦς ὀκλάξων I should interpret
as ’bent double.' Terzaghi supplies
irddas with διπλοῦς, but the chorus
are not exhorted merely to bend their legs.
Silenus encourages them to bend over the
track, but it seems from 119 that they exaggerated
his command by moving along
the trail on all-fours. For διπλοῦς in this
sense cf. Eur. El. 492 διπλῆν ἅκανθαν καὶ

may be doubted if Stallbaum was right
in connecting πάνυ with πολλοῖς.</p>
<p>100 ‘For each actual mark, as wesee
them (τάδε), is a clear proof.’ For
αὔθ᾿ ἕκαστα see on Eur. Phoen. 494.
σημαίνει is used absolutely as in Trach.
345 χὡ λόγος σημαινέτω.</p>
<p>102 The occurrence of αὐτός in 100
and 104 favours the adoption of αὐτόν
rather than αὖ τό. ‘Here is the very
imprint of their hoofs.’ ἐπίσημον, ἐπίσημα
are used of the devices stamped on
coins. On the other hand, it seems
hardly possible that ἐπίσιμον, if that
word is to be discerned in the marginal
note, could express the rolling gait of
oxen. Robrt, accepting σήματα in 96,
supposes that both lines refer to the
mark of ownership which Apollo had
branded on th hoofs of his cattle, and
that this mark had been disclosed, probably
in 52f.</p>
<p>104 ἐκμεμαγμένον: see cr. n. The
tense is a serious objection to the reading
ἐκμετρούμενον: contrast Eur. fr. 382, 3,
where the present expresses customary
action (=ὃς ἐκμετρεῖται). Tr.: ‘here is
a moulding of the very size.’—μέτρον
implies that the chorus measured the
track with their eyes, and observed its
correspondence: cf. Ai. 5 μετρούμενον |
ἴχνη τὰ κείνου νεοχάραχθ᾿ ὅπως κτἑ.</p>
<p>106 Perhaps ἀκρούμενος, if 107 followed
immediately, as was probably,
though not certainly, the case. The
lower margin is broken off, so that the
end of the column cannot be fixed.</p>
<p>107 See cr. n. Hunt's restoration is
open to two objections. (1) ῥοίβδημα
is unsuitable, as applied to the lowing
of cattle. It is true that Monk read ἐν
ῥοιβδήσει βουκολιῶν in Eur. I. A. 1086
with this meaning, but none of the subsequent
critics, except Paley, has agreed
with him. ῥοίβδησις there expresses the
whistling of the herdsmen, just as ῥοῖζος
is attributed to shepherds in Hom. ι 315.
Following the clue which these passages
suggest, I have provisionally restored as
above. (2) The usage of tragedy invariably
requires δι᾿ ὤτων (ὠτός) in the
proposed context: see Aesch. Cho. 54,
449. Soph. O. T. 1387, Ant. 1188, El.
737, 1439, fr. 858. Eur. Med. 1139,
Rhes. 294, 566.—ῥοῖβδος is παρεπιγραφή,
and appears to refer to the sound of the
lyre which the semi-chorus fails to recognize.
Wilamowitz thinks the word could
not be so applied: but see on 255. Robert
also explains ῥοῖβδος as the bellowing of
the cattle, but objects to Hunt's restoration
on the ground that, though the παρεπιγραφή
follows 107, the sound had
already been heard and correctly interpreted
by the first speaker.</p>

<p>vidual marks and the entire trail] κείνων 
τῶν βοῶν πάρα [=πάρεισι] τάδε ἐναργῆ 
μαθεῖν. Wilamowiz at one time placed 
a colon after στίβος, but subsequently 
preferred a full stop before μαθεῖν. The 
latter alternative is the better of the two, 
but there is no reason why the passage 
should not be continuous.</p> 
<p>112 f. ναὶ μὰ Δία occurs also in 
Eur. Cycl. 555, 558, 586. We may 
render: ‘nay, verily, the footprints are 
reversed and face in the opposite direction.’ 
ναί, as Shilleto remarked (Dem. 
de fals. leg. p. 285), serves not so much 
‘the purpose of affirming the preceding 
position, as of ushering in the subsequent 
objection.’ Cf. Xen. Cyrop. 1. 6. 29 οὐ 
γιγνώσκεις ὅτι κακουργίαι τέ εἰσι καὶ ... 
πλεονεξίαι; ναὶ μὰ Δί᾿, ἔφη, θηρίων γε. 
In mem. 2. 2. 11 ναὶ μὰ Δία is a protest 
against the question, ‘why, of course I 
do.’ For the sense cf. h. Herm. 344 
τῇσιν μὲν γὰρ βουσὶν ἐς ἀσφοδελὸν λειμῶνα |
ἀντία βήματ᾿ ἔχουσα κόνις ἀνέφαινε μέλαινα. 
Hunt puts a full stop after βήματα, 
and adopts the circumflex accent of the 
papyrus by reading αὖ· τάδ᾿ (see cr. n). 
But the arrangement in the text is much 
better: in English the emphasis would be 
expressed by ‘just look at them.’ For 
the emphatic position of αὐτός cf. Eur. 
Hel. 421 αὐτὰ δ᾿ εἰκάσαι | πάρεστι ναὸς  
ἔκβολ᾿ οἷς ἀμπίσχομαι.</p> 
<p>114 τουτί, The colloquial form, 
common in Aristophanes, does not occur 
elsewhere in the text of the tragedians.—
τάγματος: a rare word, mostly confined 
to late prose. But it does not seem right 
to preter the more usual and vaguer 
πράγματος.</p> 
<p>115 f. ‘The front marks have shifted 
to the back, and some again are interlaced 
facing in opposite directions to 
each other. They reach a point where 
the general direction of the trial appears 
to be reversed, so that the forward marks  
are now turned the wrong way: besides 
this, many of the hoof-marks are half 
obliterated by others going in the reverse 
direction. The language follows h. Herm. 
77 ἀντία ποιήσας ὁπλάς, τὰς πρόσθεν ὄπισθεν, 
| τὰς δ᾿ ὄπιθεν πρόσθεν, κατὰ δ᾿ ἔμπαλιν 
αὐτὸς ἔβαινε (Hermes drives the 
cows backwards, while he himself walks 
forwards). Cacus carried out the same 
trick differently: Verg. Aen. 8. 210 cauda 
in spcluncam tractos versisque viarum | 
indiciis. Hunt supports συμπεπλεγμένα 
by quoting Xen. cyn. 5. 6 τὰ ἴχνη ὀρθά 
... τοῦ δ᾿ ἦρος συμπεπλεγμένα. One might 
also conjecture συμπεφυρμένα. Robert 
takes an entirely different view of this 
passage. According to him the cunning 
of Hermes was much more complicated: 
(1) Some of the cows were driven back-wards 
[112]; (2) others had their front 
hoofs twisted inwards [115 ἐς τούπίσω... 
ἤλλακται]; (3) others again had their 
back hoofs twisted outwards [ἐναντὶ᾿ 
ἀλλήλοισι]. Since, however, this meaning 
cannot be extracted from the parallel
passage in the hymn, Robert believes 
that Sophocles was a deliberate innovator. 
The difficulty arises from a refusal to believe
that ἀντία ποιήσας ὀπλάς in Homer, 
and ἐς τούπίσω τὰ πρόσθεν ἤλλακται in 
Sophocles, can both be applied simply 
to the reversal of the direction of the 
hoofs.</p> 
<p>118 f. Hunt, reading κεκλιμένον, places 
the mark of interrogation at the end of 118. 
This requires πρόσπαιον (se. ἐστί) to be 
used in the sense of θανμαστόν, whereas 
πρόσπαιος is rather new than strange.</p>

προσπαιον.</p>
<p>121 Just as the proverb μία λόχμη
οὐ τρέφει δύο έριθάκους (Zenob. 5. 11)
implies that a bush offers only limited
accommodation, so here the satyrs are
doubled up as completely as the hedgehog,
when he is tucked into a space just
large enough for him. The ἐχῖνος cunnigly
conceals himself for purposes of
self-defence: cf. Ion Chius fr. 38, 4 στρόβιλος
ἀμθάκανθον (Salmasius for ἀμθ'
ἄκανθαν) είλίξας σέμας | κεῖται θιγεῖν τε
Καὶ δακεῖν ἀμήχανος.</p>
<p>122 The exact intention οf the allusion
is obscure. ἀποθυμαίνεις, which, if sound,
provides the only instance in the text of
an irregular anapaest (see p. 230), is an
unknown compound, and it is difficult to
perceive the relevance of any derivative
of θυμαίνω. Wilamowitz suggested that
άποθυμαίνειν was used for ἀποθυμιᾶν, and
that the latter was a synonym of ἀποπέρδεσθαι.
But the double assumption is
unwarrantable. Hunt, in order to secure
the same meaning, conjectured ἀπιθμαίνεις
from Hesych. 11 pp. 350, 371 s.vv. ιθμαίνων
and ἰσμαίνει, — evidence which fails to
prove that ίθμαίνείν could be used for
πέρδεσθαι. The associations of κύβδα are
different, if we may judge by Ar. Εq. 365
Pac. 897, Thesm. 489 (with Blaydes's n.):
in other words, it alludes to σχῆμα ἀκόλαστον
καὶ ἑταιρικόν (schol. Ar. Lys. 231).
Hence I formerly suggested ποθομανής on
the analogy of ἐρωτομανής. but would now
prefer πόθον ένείς (Eur. Bacch. 851), as a
somewhat easier change and as accounting
better for τινί.</p>
<p>123 τί ταῦτα; see on Eur. Hel. 991
and Gildersleeve, Synt. § 132.</p>
<p>125 ὕ ὖ, which recurs at 170, is an
exclamation of alarm; not of admiration,
as in Ar. Plut. 895, where schol. R remarks:
έπίρρημα θαυμαστικόν, ὅπερ ἔν τῆ

<p>127 ἔχων is colloquial. It is explained
by Kuehner-Gerth 11 62 (followed
by Starkie on Ar. Nub. 131) as originally
transitive (i.e. ἔχων governs τί). Subsequentlly
it became intransitive, as employed
in Ar. Ran. 202 οὐ μὴ φλυαρήσεις
ἔχων, ib. 512 ληρεῖς ἔχων. It follows
that in the fifth century ἔχων was no
longer considered to be transitive.</p>
<p>128f. The supplement of Wilamowitz
ἀγχοῦ τις ἤχει κέρχνοσ· was adopted by
Hunt in both his editions. In that case,
it would seem necessary also to accept
ipielpu from the same critic; for, as he
says, the chorus have not shown any
desire to investigate the sound. But we
may very well read ἀλλ᾿ οὐ τίς . . . ἱμείρεις
μαθεῖν; as in the text, with τί δῆτα (Hunt)
in place of τι ἦν; τί in the following line.
ἀλλὰ is idiomatic in introducing a fresh
question, as explained by Maetzner on
Lycurg. 144. — For κέρχνος see on fr. 279.
— The reading of Theon σιγᾶθ' οἱ) is
very much more forcible, as marking the
contrast with their former loquacity.

<p>144 σώματα does not seem to be
used alone in the contemptuous sense of

<p>145 Φαλῆτες. Satyric choruses wore
the phallus: cf. Eur. Cycl. 439 and see
Haigh, Attic Theatre3, p. 294. For the

εἰ.. δέῃ, at a pinch. For the subjunctive
with εἰ cf. Ο. C. 1443, Ant. 710, Ar. Eq.
698. It is not easy to recover the nuance
of the construction, or to understand
why it was occasionally preferred to the
normal uses. Neil (on Eq. l.c.) seems
to think that it was paratragoedic in
Aristophanes, but it may rather have
been the literary survival of an almost
extinct colloquialism, like our an ’t please
you. For other examples see Kuehner-
KuehnerGerth 11 474.</p>
<p>147 τοιοῦδε πατρός is isolated. In
order to show that it is a continuation of

<p>148 The exploits of Silenus, his
wanderings with Dionysus, and his share
in the battle with the giants, are recorded
in Eur. Cycl. 2 — 9. Wilamowitz (p.455)
thinks that the present passage refers
rather to hunting adventures (Jagdabenteuer):
see on 152.</p>
<p>149 οἴκοις νυμΦικοῖς: i.e. in the
caves of the nymphs. Cf. Horn. h.

to flight. For the use of κλίνω cf. Polyb.

Aristid. I p. 178 ἐπεὶ δ’ ἔκλινε τὰ πράγματα.
In Eur. Suppl. 704 ἔκλινε γὰρ
κέρας | τὸ λαιὸν ἡμῶν the verb might be
intransitive, although the editors are probably
right in making κέρας the object. —
δειλουμένου (see cr. n.) is rather more
pointed than δουλουμένου, which requires
to be defined (e.g. by τῇ γνώμῃ). Wilamowitz
compares ἀγριοῦσθαι, γαυριοῦσθαι,
etc.</p>
<p>152 αἰχμαῖσιν. The plural indicates
different occasions, and by the use of the
word the speaker does not so much refer
to a definite weapon as to martial achievements
ments in general. Thus the meaning is
equivalent to ui et armis, or practically
to ‘in ’ Cf. Eur. fr. 16 λαμπροὶ
δ’ ἐν αὀχμαἰς Ἄρεος ἔν τε συλλόγοις.
Phoen. 1273 αἰχμὴν ἐς μίαν καθέστατον.
Soph. Phil. 1307 κακοὺς | ὄντας πρὸς
αἰχμήν. See also Wilamowitz on Eur.
Her. 158. — Hunt gives ἀκμαῖσιν with a
colon after ἐξειργασμένου, though I do
not understand how his reading admits of
the translation ‘but did deeds of ’
But it is surely far more natural to suppose
that the object of ἐξειργασμένου is the
antecedent to ἅ (i.e. deeds which) in 153
than that the relative looks back to μνήματα
in 148. Nevertheless, Wilamowitz
also takes μνήματα to be the immediate
antecedent of ἅ. Both he and Robert
infer from the text that Silenus is boasting
not of his martial exploits, but of his
prowess as a hunter, i.e. (I suppose) the

<p>object of ἐξειργασμένυ ‘having destroyed’
is βοτά. The removal of the
colon makes this assumption unnecessary,
and in my opinion clears up the whole
passage. It follows, of course, that I
cannot assent to Robert's conception of
the character of Silenus as standing on a 
much loftier plane of morality than the 
mean-spirited sot in the Cyclops. See 
also on 199 ff.</p>
<p>153 f. ἀορρυπαίνεται is more emphatic
and therefore better than ὐπορρυπαίνεται
(cr. n.). Wilamowitz holds that
there is a lacuna after this line, on the
ground that the dative ψόφῳ is otherwise
intolerably harsh, unless supported by
a participle like ἐκπλαγέντων. But this
is unduly to limit the sphere of the causal
(instrumental) dative, which is not infrequently
applied to the influence of
external circumstances in the place of
διά c. acc. See El. 549, Trach. 1127,

Εl. 149 χέρα δὲ κρᾶτ᾿ ἐπὶ κούριμον | τιθεμένα
θανάτῳ σῷ. I dwell upon this 
the more, because the examples given by
Kuehner-Gerth I 439 are not representative
of this aspect of the idiom.—κόλακι
is obscure, and, if Hunt is right in 
rendering it ‘cheating,’ one see 
whom shpherds are supposed to delude.
I suggest that there is a contemptuous allusion
to the soothing of the shepherd's pipe:
Eur. fr. 773, 27 σύριγγας δ᾿ οὐριβάται | κινοῦσιν
ποίμνας, ἐλάται. Alc. 577 βοσκήμασι
σοῖσι συρίζων | ποιμνίτας ὑμεναίους. Rhes.
551 ἤδη δὲ νέμουσι κατ᾿ Ἴδαν | ποίμνια·
νυκτιβρόμου σύριγγος ἰὰν κατακούω. Soph.
Phil. 213 oὑ μολπὰν σύριγγος ἔχων, ὠς
ποιμὰν ἀγροβότας. Eur. Hel. 1483 σύριγγι
πειθόμεναι ποιμένος,—transferred to
the crances. What else than the strains
of the pipe can be the ‘shepherds’ noise’?
The shepherd pipes to his flock which
obeys him : i.e. Observe how this description
of the sound confirms the interpretation
given of 107. Hunt places a 
comma at the end of 154, and accepts ὅν
from Wilamowitz in 155; but the multiplication
of relative clauses is rather to 
be avoided.</p>
<p>155 The child’s fear of the unknown
may be illustrated from Plat. Phaed. 77 K*iiepirTTt
ἴσως ἔνι τις καὶ ἐν ἠμῖν παῖς ὅς τὰ τοιαῦτα
φοβεῖται. To be afraid before you have
cause is like crying out before you are
hurt (Phil. 917, Ar. Plut. 477).</p>
<p>156 χρυσόφαντον is a new compound.
Cf. 45.</p>
<p>157 ἀνεδίξατο is a formal word for
to undertake, acknowledge,become reponsible
for. Cf. Isac. 3. 18. Dem. 33.
22, 35. 7. 46. 7, 59. 58.</p>
<p>159 εὔδετε : γε are idle. The application
to persons in the metaphorical
sense is Sophoclean : O.T. 65 ὤστ᾿ οὐχ
ὕπνῳ γ᾿ εὔδοντά μ᾿ ἐξεγείρετε. Ο. C. 307
κεἰ βραδύς | εὔδει.</p>
<p>160 ἀνανοστήσαντες, nor to pursued
(Hunt) but to return to the path. It 
should be remembered that the simple
verb does not primarily or chiefly mean
to return.—For the minatory condition
see Goodwin, § 447.</p>

’s is unnecessary.
I suppose ΨοΦήσετε to have been deliberately
chosen instead of βοήσεσθε in
reference to the disturbing ΒοήΦος of 154
just as conversely βοᾶν is sometimes
ironically applied to inanimate objects
(e.g. Ar. Ran. 859). It is difficult to say
whether the dative is rather causal or
circumstantial, but the character of the
noun distinguishes this example from
the familiar type of fr. 958. Maas, however
thinks that ψοΦήσετε is a vulgarism
for ἀπολεῖσθε, on the ground that it is
used with that sense in Byzantine and
modern Greek. Wilamowitz calls attention
to the similar development of διαΦωνεῖν
(Agatharchides ap. Phot. bibl. 457,25). 25).</p>
<p>163 συμποδηγέτει: this is a new
word beside συμποδηγεῖν, corresponding
to ποδηγετεῖν: : ποδηγεῖν. Cf. κυνηγετεῖν :
κυνηγεῖνλ.</p>
<p>165 αὐτός appears to belong to παρῇς,
as well as to παρών in 163 and 166.
In each case it bears a considerable
emphasis : ’Father, do come ’
and so forth.</p>
<p>166 ποσβιβῶ λόγῳ, not Ἱ will
urge you on by my voice ’ (Hunt) but Ἱ

superiority. Cf. Ar. Αυ. 425 προσβιβᾷ

168 ιει in εἶ’ corr. pap. | ἀΦίστω scripsi: ἐΦίστω</p>
<p>168 ἑΦίστω was adopted by Hunt
and Wilamowitz, and compared with
Track. 339 τοῦ με τήνδ᾿ ἐΦίστασαι βάσιν,
which would then be interpreted ‘why
dost thou approach me ’ The
present passage is rendered ‘take your
stand at the ’ ; and, since the
relevance of the remark to the situation
is not apparent, Wilamowitz constructs
an elaborate tnise en scene in justification
of the text. Three paths are represented
on the stage, converging at the cave of
Cyllene, and possibly rising towards it.
The chorus in the orchestra divide themselves
into three bodies, each of which
follows one of the paths indicated. He
points out that the wooden stage-buildings
provided for each performance allowed
considerable freedom to the poet for the
arrangement of his stage. In conformity
with the supposed conditions, he divides
the chorus into three rather than two
sections in the passage beginning at
v. 94. This is ingenious rather than
convincing, and τριζύγης οἵμου is too
slender a foundation to support the
superstructure. I have proposed to restore
ἀφίστω, which yields a simple and
appropriate meaning. To stand at the
cross-roads, i.e. at a point where the
road bifurcates (as explained by Gildersleeve
on Pind. Pyih. II. 38 κατ’ ἀμευσιπόρους
τριόδους ἐδινήθην, | ὀρθὰν κέλευθον

ὅπῃ δύνᾳ scriptum fuisse, sed βέλτιον esse ὄπῃ θέλεις in marg. testatur pap.2</p>
<p>a paragraph us appears after 210, which
is unnecessary and unusual if the speech
which follows is to be attributed to the
coryphaeus. Hunt, however, considering 
it obvious that 200—203 belong to
the chorus, and 204—206 to Silenus,
corrects the division of 199 by combining
τί ἔστιν with σίγα. as a remark of Silenus,
and continuing accordingly. Being also
of opinion that μέν᾿, εἰ θέλεις is unsuitable
as addressed by Silenus to the chorus,
and that the repetition of θέλεις is awkward
if ὄπῃ θέλεις is adopted in 200—
though the latter contention can hardly
be admitted — he accepts Wilamowitz's
proposal to transfer δύνᾳ. from 200 to
199, and attributes μέν᾿ εἰ δύνᾳ to Silenus.
By giving 211 — 214 to Silenus, he allows
paragraphus after 210 its usual
If that view is correct, the
upshot of the dialogue will be that the
are again alarmed by hearing the
and propose to withdraw from
the search altogether in favour of their
father, but that, after three lines spoken
by Silenus, forth with resume their
labours. I cannot help thinking that,
if such was the purpose of Sophocles,
his dramatic instinct was temporarily in
abeyance. As against Wilamowita, however
Hunt attributes 252 ff. as well as
the subsequent dialogue with Cyllene
to the chorus and not to Silenus; and
he is consequently driven to suppose
that Silenus runs off in alarm directly
Cyllene appears. See further in this connexion
on 357.</p>
<p>It appears to me, however, not only
that the MS arrangement of 199 is susceptible
of defence, but that by distributing
the following speeches in accordance
with its requirements we obtain a comic
effect which is exactly in keeping with
the caracter of Silenus, and avoid the
necessity of accounting for his subsequent
disappearance. The difficulty of the
paragraphus after 210 I cannot regard as
serious. We do not know enough to
feel sur that it might not have been
intended to divide the lyrics from the
senarii; and in any case errors in its
employment are frequent (cf. 68). We
suppose, then, that Silenus hears the
noise clearly for the first time at v. 198,
and is so terrified that he resolves to
depart at once and does so, althogh the
chorus apparently attempt to keep him.
On that assumption, the ironical tone of
μέν᾿ εἰ θέλεις, ‘do please stay,’ or ‘won't$
you stay? ’ is exactly suitable to the occasion,
if the chorus are now aware that
Silenus is rather more frightened than the
rest of them. Cf. Phil. 730 ἔρπ᾿, εἰ
θέλεις (‘Ι pray thee, come on’), and El.
585 εἰ γὰρ θέλεις, δίδαξον (where the tone
is ironical, as here: see Jebb's n.). In
200, so far as the sense is concerned, it is
indifferent whether we read ὅπῃ θέλεις or
ὅπῃ δύνᾳ (see cr. n.), but the former is to
be preferred for the reason that δύνασθαι
is a very common gloss on θέλειν in conditions
similar to the present. See schol.

grotesque cowardice of Silenus after his
vapourings in 147 ff. may be illustrated
by his similar behaviour in the Cyclops
(228 ff), as well as by the general description
of the satyrs in Νonnus (14.
121): ἐν δὲ κυδοιμοῖς | πάντες ἀπειλητῆρες
ἀεὶ φεύγοντες Ἐνυώ, | νόσφι μόθοιο λέοντες
ἐνὶ πτολέμοις δὲ λαγωοί. I have accordingly
proposed to complete 202 f. by reading
ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ | μὴ πλεῖστον ἔτι μένοντα διατρίβειν
χρόνον, which is consistent with
the indications of the papyrus. Robert's
view of the character of Silenus as ‘himmelweit
verschieden’ from the portrait
given by Euripides has already been
mentioned in the n. on 152. He goes so
far as to claim that the speech beginning
at 139 is worthy of Ajax or anyother tragic hero. </p>

ἔχει στέγη.</p>
<p>208 ff. φθέγμ’ ἀφύσεις is restored by 
Hunt from the margin, since the text is 
mutilated. He gives reasons against
accepting ἄ ἀφσᾷς (Wilamowitz) and
suggest that ἀφύξεις may have been the
reading in the text. No parallel is 
quoted for the phrase φθέγμ’ ἀφύσσειν,
but it may be illustrated by γλῶσσειν
ἐκχέας in fr. 929 (n.): the papyruw gives
φθέγγμα here, as well as in 254,278,292,
and 320, and that form was approved by
Herodian (Crönert, Mem. Gr. Hercul.
p. 69). —μισθὸν ὀλβίσῃς, if joined as
‘produce rich pay,’ would be parallel to 
τυφλοῦν ἕλκος (Ant. 973) and the rest.</p>
<p>211 ὅδ’...ἀλλ’: ‘he won't show himself 
for that : well, then....’ Hunt, who
prefers ὁ δ’, makes Silenus the speaker,
and treats τοῖσιν cannot be instumental
(causal), he undoubtedly goes too far :
see the passages quoted on 154 and esp.
Antiph. 5. 3 ἄπιστοι γενόμενοι τοῖς ἀληθέσιν
αὐτοῖς τούτοις ἀπώλοντο.</p>
<p>212 φέρων, bringing into play,
applying to the case. Cf. Eur. Tro. 333
ἕλισσε τᾷδ’ ἐκεῖσε μετ’ ἐμέθεν ποδῶν
| φέρουσα φιλτάταν βάσιν. —πέδορτον is 
a new word, but appears to be a suibable
epithet for the sound produced by feet
striking against th ground. Robert
however prefers Leo's φωρῶν (for φέρων):
i.e. tracking out the sound rising from
the ground. But it is surely unnatural
to dissociate κτύπον from εἰσακοῦσαι.</p>
<p>213 πηδήμασιν. Cf. Vergil's taltantcs
21 πηδήμασιν. Cf. Vergil's saltantes
Satyros (Ecl. 5. 73). Cornut. 30.
p. 59 οἰ Σκιρτοὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ σκαίρειν. Robert
seems to be right in rejecting Leo's veiw,
based on Ter. Eun. 285 and other passages,
that λακτίσμασιν refers to kicks
delivered against the door.</p>
<p>214 ὥστ’ is actually redundant after
ἐξαναγκάσων, but is often so employed
order to emphasize the result (Eur. Hel.
1040 n., Jebb on Soph. O.C. 270). —Hunt
substitutes ᾖ for εἶ on the ground that the
third speaker should turn to address directly
the unseen occupant cf. O. T. 1198,
Bacchyl. 9. 13. Robert also questions
the necessity for Hunt's alteration, but 
thinks that the text is a conflation of two
readings, one of which was ὥστ’ εἰσακούσῃ..εἶ.</p>

ἡδὺν κάματον τ’ εὐκάματον, but his further
contention that πόνος was a technical
expression for the song and dance of the
tragic chorus is not established by the 
evidence which he cites.</p>
<p>218 ff. This is the most puzzling
passage in the text so far so it has been recovered,
chiefly owing to the difficulty of 
identifying the maste4r whose proceedings
are here described. The general question
has been certain points of detail whcih
arise here still require notice. (I) Huntsuggested
(p. 79) that Silenus might be
the δεσπότης; and, partly no doubt for
this reason, was induced to accept παίδων
from Wilamowitz in 222. Apart from
other difficulties, a conclusive objection
is that Silenus himself, as well as his
children, was in sevitude to some master
(57, 69). (2) The theory of Wilamowitz,
who holds that the master's indentity
was revealed in the latter part of the
play, has been already discussed. It
shoudl be added that Wilamowitz does
not explain how his emendation of 222
can be reconciled with his refusal to put
forward any conjecture on the main
question. (3) Robert thinks taht the
sverice of Dionysus is meant. This is 
no douht the first idea that suggests
itself; but it cannot be made to harmonize
with the text as it stands, and Robert is 
forced to conclude that a line has been
lost after 220, containing the verb required
for Dionysus (e.g. ἡγεῖτο) and the subject
of εὐιάζετο (i.e. Silenus). (4) It has
already been suggested that the δεσπότης
must have been Apollo, since the satyrs
hands; and it has been shown that there
is nothing surprising in the introduction
of Apollo into the Bacchic thiasus. What
is then to be made of σὺν ἐγγόνοις νύμφαισι?
In answer it may be remarked that
Nymphs, and that he bore the special
title of Νυμφηγέτης at Thasos and at 
Samos (Wernicke in Pauly-Wissowa 11
61). That title, however must be intimately
related to, if it is not merely
a substitute for, the better-known Mουσηγέτης
(Pausan. 1. 2. 5, Pind. fr. 116).
Further, since there is respectable authority
(Eumel.fr. 17 K.) for the statement
that Apollo was the father of the Muses,
it is not extravagent to suppose that he
might also have been described—particularly
in a passage to which his function
as Νυμφηγέτης is entirely relevant—as
father of the Nymphs. [In C.R. XXXVI
310 I enumerated the difficulties involved
in these lines, and threw out certain
suggestions for their removal. But Wilamowitz
(Sappho u. Smonides, p. 922) has
shown that ἔν-γονος does not exist, and
that ἔγγονος is always ἔκ-γονος. Besides,
except as a last resource, we are not
justified in disturbing the text.] </p>
<p>εῖχες: see cr. n. εῖπες yields no interlligible
meaning. and Wilamowitz's correction
seems inevitable [εῖδες in ed. min. is
an error].—νεβρίνῃ. a new word. corresponding 
to φήγωος, λάινος, and many
others, where the suffix denotes material.
See Brugmann, Comp. Gr. 11 p. 156 E. tr.—

mental agitation, as in Plat. rep. 330 D
(the stories about Hades) στρέφουσιν
αὐτοῦ τὴν ψυχὴν μὴ ἀληθεῖς ὦσιν.—κατέκλυον: 
see cr. n. Against κατήλυθεν it
may be urged taht ἤλυθον is not used
elsewhere by Sophocles in dialogue, and 
that the meaning of the compound is 
far from clear. But I fail to understand 
why Hunt's punctuation (cr. n.) should be 
considered essential to the adoption of 
κατέκλυον.</p>
<p>225 πρέπον, of sound clearly heard.
Cf. Aesch. Ag. 333 οἶμαι βοὴν ἄμεικτον
ἐν πόλει πρέπειν. There is a similar
transference from sight to sound in 322 f.
and in O. T. 186 παιὰν δὲ λὰμπει.</p>
<p>226 θηρὸς εὐναίου τροφῆς: the brood
of a beast in its lair. For εὐναῖος cf. fr.
174, and for the concrete sense fo τροφή
τροφή. Eur. Cycl. 189 μηκάδων ἀρνῶν
τροφαί. Wilamowiz, however, reading
εὐναίας, thinks that den, or lair, is the
meaning required and conjectures στροφῆς
(coll. ἐπιστροφαί, ἀναστροφαί).</p>
<p>227 f. are not easy to be constructed similarly
to Rhes. 875 οὐ γὰρ ἐς σὲ τείνεται
| γλῶσσ’, ὡς σὺ κομπεῖς. Ηence I was
inclined to read αἰτίαι φωρῶν κάτα | γλώστετραμμέναι),
but αἰτίαι is impossible and 
ἐτείνο[ντ’] ἐς is barely consistent with
the traces. Hunt thought that the letter
before αι was κ (i.e. καί), but could not
find a suitable word to precede it which
might be the subject of ἐτείνετ’. Ηe
also believed that εωαι was the remnant
of a perfect infinitive; but it would be 
difficult to accommodate one to the
context. ἄν appears to be iterative.
αὖτις, which the recurrence in 229 makes
almost certain (ἀν’ αὐλήν, Murray), is
proved to be Attic by the new Menander
(Epitr. 362, Sam. 281, 292). See Wila-

Ionic by the authorities (Weir Smyth,
Ionic Dialect, p. 298). L gives αὖτις
in O. C. 234 and elsewhere, and the
editors have perhaps been too hasty in
rejecting it. See also fr. 599.</p>
<p>231 The description evidently passes
to the conduct initiated at 211.—σύν,
restored by Murray where the papyrus
is illegible, is considered by Hunt not
entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>232 πάμφυρτ’, confusedly, is the adverbial
acc. commonly found with verbs
of motion. See Jebb on Ai. 196. Eur.
Hel. 455 (n.), Phoen. 311 (n.).</p>
<p>233 The meaning may be otherwise
than in the actual circumstances’ (e.g.  ἤ
[or εἰ] κλύουσ᾿ ἐμάνθανον.)</p>
<p>234 παραπιπαισμένων,mad, foolish
(from παραπαίω, which is also used absolutely 
= deliro). Cf. Lucian hist. conscr.

Ηesych. ΙΙΙ pp. 271, 275 s.υυ. παράπαισμα
(παραίπαιμα), παράπαιστος.</p>
<p>235 f. Hunt states taht φαίην ἄν is
more suitable to the conditons than ἔφην
ἄν, and suggests some such context as
αἰναῖσι...φρινῶν (δαιμόνων) ...νόσζις, adding
however that ἅν φρενῶν cannot both
be read. In 236 the first five letters after
the gap are doubtful, and ἔτι ποεῖτ’ is
hardly satisfactory. ἔπτοεῖτ’, which Hunt
reluctantly gives up, is said to be inconsistent
with teh remains.</p>
<p>237 ff. The ode corresponds to 283 ff.,
as appears from the number of the lines
and the equnivalence of 244 to 290. The
metre, which is quite simple, is iambic</p>
<p>239 sq. supplevit Murray | νύμφη pap.
(crettic). The ithyphallic clausula may be
illustrated by Ant. 852, 976, El. 1089.
The ends of the lines have been admirably
restored by Diehl, Murray, Hunt,
and Wilamowitz.</p>
<p>νύμφα: see on 65.—βαθύζωωε: the
word is now generally distinguished from
βαθύκολπος, but its original (Homeric)
meaning is uncertain. Helbig, who 
formerly explained it as ‘long-waisted’
from ε 231, has since changed his mind
and now agrees with Studniczka that the
(Iwan Mueller, Privalalt. 2 p. 83.) βαθύζωνος
does not occur in Eur. or elsewhere
in Soph., and in Aesch. the commentators
are not agreed whether it is merely an
ornamental epithet applicable to any
woman, or carries with it an implication
of luxury and delicate nurture (see Verrall
and Tucker on Theb. 850 nd Cho. 168).
In Pindar it is applied to Leda, Latona,
the Graces, and the Muses (Gidlersleeve
on Ol. 3. 37), and it is a fair inference
that Sophocles used it as a complimentary
epithet to signify beautiful proportions
and elegant appearel.</p>
<p>238 ἤκω φίρων (cr. n.), as in O.C.
357, 579, Phil. 1267, is better than
Murray's ἤκει σέ τοι (cf. for the acc. fr.
94).</p>
<p>239 οὐδ’. If the text is right, οὐδέ
is intended to contrast the second clause
instead of correlating it. That is to say,
it would imply : ‘no, nor yet....’ Where
this is intended. we often have οὐδ’ αὖ,
οὐδέ γε, etc. : Kuchner-Gerth ΙΙ 290.

<p>and it is not clear that οὐδ’ is justified
here.—ἄξενος, uncivil, as in Plat. soph.
217 E τὸ δὲ αὖ σοὶ μὴ χαρίζεσθαι. . . ἄξενόν
τι καταφαίνεταί μοι καὶ ἄγριον.</p>
<p>240 μάταιος, expressing the presumption
of rash folly, as (in another
sphere) in trach. 565 ψαύει ματαίαις
χερσίν. Such recklessness of speech was
exhibited by Lycurgus: Ant. 961 ψαύων
τὸν θεὸν ἐν κερτομίοις γλώσσαις.</p>
<p>241 προψαλάξῃς: see on fr. 550.
Here the meaning is: ‘don’t assail me
too soon with taunts.</p>
<p>242 εὐπετῶς: readily. So Eur. Cycl.
526 ὅπου τιθῇ τις, ἐνθάδ’ ἐστὶν εὐπετής
(‘ contented ’).</p>
<p>243 νέρθε γᾶς is of course only a
guess, although it suits the context very
well. If the sound of the lyre was represented
as coming from under the ground,
it would agree with κάτω δονεῖ (282).
Robert thinks that is why the chorus
went on all fours (119 ff.): see also
on 212.</p>
<p>244 θέσπιν αὐδάν sounds like a
travesty of Homer’s θέσπιν ἀοιδήν (θ 498),
which, by a curious coincidence, is applied
by Euripides to the music of the lyre
(Med. 425).</p>
<p>245 ff. The restorations of these lines
clearly satisfy the sense, even if they do
not represent the actual words of the
original.</p>
<p>247 ἀλκασμάτων might signify
‘niolent attacks, since ἀλκάζειν· μάχεσθαι
appears in Etym. M. p. 56, 10;
66, 10. But λακασμάτων (cr. n.), ‘howlings,
would be much more to the point.
For the gen. (= ἢ ἀλκάσμασιν) cf. Ant.
74 ἐπεὶ πλείων χρόνος |ὃν δεῖ μ’ ἀρέσκειν
τοῖς κάτω τῶν ἐνθάδε, O.C. 567 τῆς ἐς
αὔριον |οὐδὲν πλέον μοι σοῦ μέτεστιν
ἡμέρας. kuehner-Gerth 11 308.</p>
<p>249 ὀρθοψάλακτον is interpreted by
Hunt as ‘shrill-sounding’ (as if for
ὀρθιο—). The point is obscure owing
to the rarity of ψαλάσσω, but it might be
suggested that the force of ὀρθός is the
same as in fr. 1077. Then the whole
compound would mean ‘niolently roused’;
but it must be admitted that this meaning
would not suit 321, where see n.</p>
<p>252 This speech is given by Hunt
to the coryphaeus (see on 199 ff.), but by
Wilamowitz and Robert to Silenus.
Reasons have already been given for
agreeing with the former view, and I
cannot assent to Robert’s argument that
in that case ἦλθον should have been
ἤλθομεν.—σθένος. For the periphrasis,
which is also Homeric, cf. trach. 507
ὃ μὲν ἦν ποταμοῦ σθένος.</p>
<p>254 See cr. n. Theon’s variant is
clearly inferior, however we interpret the
text. Hunt rendered ‘tell us of this
voice which resounds’; but, if that is</p>

<p>254 τοῦτο πῶς φωνεῖ legisse Theonem testator pap. 2, τοῦθ’ δ περιφωνεῖ H. Richards</p>
<p>the meaning, he was well advised in the
ed. min. to accept ὂ τεριφωνεῖ, the ingenious
correction of H. Richards. the
objection to this course is that φράζω is
not used by Soph. with an accusative of
the direct object in the sense of ‘to
explain.’ It is simpler therefore to regard
ὅπερ φωνεῖ as an object-clause: ‘tell us
what this sound means.’ Cf. Phil. 559
φράσον δ’ἄπερ γ’ ἔλεξας. O. t. 655
φράζε δὴ τί φής.</p>
<p>255 αὐτῷ διαχαράσσεται is rendered
by Hunt ‘expresses himself therewith.’
But that is hard to justify, and I should
prefer to suppose that there is an allusion
to the sound of the πλῆκτρον as it scrapes
across the strings of the lyre. Cf. Plut.
de sall. an. 20 p. 974 B ὁ δὲ δράκων τῷ
μαράθρῳ τὸν ὁφθαλμὸν ἀμβλυώττοντα
λεπτύνων καὶ διαχαράττων. We might
render: ‘who in the world is setting our
teeth on edge with it?’ Compare the
contemptuous use of catgut-scraper and
the like in English; for the humour of
the situation was enhanced by the satyrs’
lack of musical appreciation. Wilamowitz
seems to recognize this by the reference
to ‘Silen, dem sie (Musik) durch
Mark und Bein geht’ (p. 451 1). but
refuses to admit that the παρεπιγραφή
(ῥοῖβδος 107) can be used for the sound
of the lyre. Rossbach’s conjecture αὐτὸ
διαχαρίζεται is mistaken.</p>
<p>257 τὸν ἑξ ἐμοῦ, an emphatic variation
for τὸν ἐμόν, occurs also in Trach. 631
τὸν πόθον τὸν ἐξ ἐμοῦ. Ant. 95 τἠν ἐξ
ἐμοῦ δυσβουλίαν.</p>
<p>258 ζημία πορίζεται: ‘punishment
p.
is in store for you, in case you reveal. . . . ’
The apodosis to εἰ φανεῖτε is contained in
ζημία, and πορίζεται is unconditional.
Cf. Isocr. 4. 157 ἀρὰς ποιοῦνται, εἶ τις
ἐπικηρυκεύεται Πέρσαις, quoted by Goodwin
§ 490.</p>
<p>260 ὅπως μὴ. . ἵξεται. For the future
indicative with ὅπως μή in a pure
final clause see Goodwin § 324. From
Sophocles is quoted Phil. 1068 μὴ προσλεῦσσε . . . ἠμῶν ὅπως μὴ τὴν τύχην διαφθερεῖς.
Another instance is El. 954 εἰς
σὲ δὴ βλέπω, |ὄπως τὸν αὐτόχειρα . . μὴ
κατοκνήσεις κτανεῖν, where hoever Jebb
prefers to regard εἰς σὲ βλέπω as cquivalent
to a verb of entreaty, and as followed by
an object clause accordingly.</p>
<p>262 ff. Hunt supplies τήνδ’ ἧκε, κἀξέπραξεν
ἁβουλεύσατο, after Murray.
rossbach preferred στέγην, Ἀτλαντίδος
|σεμνἢς ἔρωτος ὡς ἄπαξ ἐγεύσατο, |ἔκρυψεν
αὐτήν. . .ἀπἥλθε λήθῃ κτέ. But Terzaghi
is perhaps right in requiring that Maia’s
name should be mentioned here. One
might gucss for 263 νὐμφης τε, in which
case θεᾶς would refer to Hera, as is
suggested by h. Herm. 6–9.</p>
<p>265 μόνον cannot be taken with
σπεος in the sense of ἔρημον, but apparently
belongs to παῖδα,—‘an only child.’
Cf. Eur. Andr. 1083 (Pelcus refers to
Neoptolemus) παῖς μόνου παιδὸς μόνος.</p>
<p>266 The association of Cyllene with
Hermes as his nurse is mentioned also by
Philostephanus (school. Pind. Ol. 6. 129)
ἐν τῷ περὶ Κυλληνης (FHG 111 30), and
Festus s. y. Cyllenius. Robert (p. 553 3)

<p>is probably right in inferring that Sophocles
was the ultimate authority for the
statement, and that his object was to
avoid the necessity of making Maia
confess to her intrigue with Zeus.</p>
<p>267 χειμάζεται is often applied to
physical pain: Phil. 1459 Ἑρμαῖον ὄρος
παρέπεμψεν ἐμοὶ | στόνον ἀντίτυπον χειμαζομένῳ.
Ai. 206 Αἴας θολερῷ | κεῖται
χειμῶνι νοςήσας. The metaphor, though
strange to us, was quite familiar to the
Greeks, so that χειμών, χειμάζεσθαι, etc.
became technical in medical circles. For
examples see Lobeck, Phryn. p. 387.
Epicur. fr. 452 Us. τὴν σάρκα τὸ παρὸν
μόνον χειμάζειν</p>
<p>268 κἄδεσμα (cr. n.), as co-ordinate
with the other substantives, is preferable
to ἐδεστά, whith Hunt accepted.</p>
<p>269 λικνῖτιν. The word λίκνον
comes from h. Herm. 21. 150, etc. Miss
J. E. Harrison in J. H. S. XXIII 294
gives reproductions from art of the λίκνον
used as a cradle, in one of which Hermes
is represented sitting up, and looking
at the stolen cows. ‘The liknon-cradle
]is a wickerwork shoe-shaped basket with
two handles.’</p>
<p>270 ἐξευθετίζω is a plausible restoration,
although the compound is new.—
νύκτα καὶ καθ’ ἡμέραν, night and day
alike. Cf. El. 259 κατ’ ἦμαρ καὶ κατ’
εὐφρόνην ἀεί, and for the absence of the
prep. with the first noun ib. 780 οὔτε
νυκτὸς . . οὔτ’ ἐξ ἡμέρας. Eur. Bacch.
1009 ἦμαρ εἰς νύκτα τε.</p>
<p>272 ἄπαυστος: I have adopted
this supplement in preference to μέγιστος,
as being more suitable to αὔξεται.
273 ἕκτον ἦμαρ. This is a deviation,
prompted by dramatic conditions, from
the version of the hymn (17 f.), according
to which Hermes, after inventing the
lyre in the morning, stole the cattle on
the evening of the day of his birth.
For a possible ritual significance see F. M.
Cornford, Origin of Attic Comedy, p. 87.
The marginal variant (see cr. n.), in
Robert’s opinion, implies that the alternative
reading was ἐννέ’ ἡμέρας πεφασμένος,
since no other numeral is adaptable
to ti.—ἐκπεφασμένος, brought forth,
as in Hom. T 104 σήμερον ἄνδρα φόωσδε
μογοστόκος εἰλείθυια | ἐκφανεῖ.</p>
<p>274 See cr. n. The objection to
γυίοις is not that it cannot be combined
with παιδός (which then follows ἥβης),
but that the instrumental datibe, though
grammatically possible, involves an unnatural
harshness of expression. I formerly
conjectured μέτροις, but now prefer τύπους,
which simplifies the construction by providing
ἐρείδει with an object. With τύπους
παιδός, ‘his childish mould,’ cf. Eur.
Hclid. 857 νέων βραχιόνων . . ἡβητὴν τύπον.
Aesch. Suppl. 288 γυναικείοις τύποις.
Soph. Trach. 12 (according to the MSS)
ἀνδρείῳ τύπῳ. So  also Aesch. Theb. 475,
Eur. Bacch. 1331.</p>
<p>275 f. Athen. 62 F Ἀττικοὶ δ’ εἰσὶν

Eustath. Il. p. 899, 17, but without the
name of the play, and with the variant
κἀξορμενίζειν οὐκ Meineke corrected
ἐπισχολάζεται to ἔτι σχολάζεται, and his
view is now confirmed by the papyrus.

i.e. The cavern, as a place securely
protected against intrusion. Similarly in
Eur. Suppl. 1010 Διὸς θησανρόν is applied
to the bidental of Capaneus (ἄβατον).
Miss Harrison (Essays to Ridgeway, p.
140), however, understands that the cavedwelling
was an under-ground storehouse
or granary like the σιροί of fr. 276.</p>
<p>277 κατάσχετος has been preferred
to ὅυσεύρετος on the ground that a word
expressing intentional concealment is required.
—θίσα, which does not occur
elsewhere in tragedy, is probably rather
disposition than command.</p>
<p>278 ff. For the palaeographical data
see Hunt’s n. While decisively rejecting
it, he indicates a possibility that the beginnings
of the lines 278–289, which are
on a separate fragment, should be moved
a line lower down. In 278 Hunt’s ἀφανεῖ
δ’ ὃ πεύθῃ φθέγμα appears to suit the context;
for, although φθέγμα ἐμηχανήσατο
is an odd phrase, it is justified by 320.
In 280 ἐμηχανήσατο seems inevitable, but
it is difficult to find a suitable supplement;
for, as Hunt remarks, ‘neither κίστης,
κάλπης (Murray), nor κόγχης is convincing.’
On the other hand, θηρὸς ἐκ
θανόντος and δονεῖ, which were propsed
by Wilamowitz, are highly probable, and
the same critic’s ἄγγος εὖρε (or ηὖρε?) καί
is an attractive coniecture.—κάτω: i.e. in
the θησανρότ. Cf. 243 n. For δονεῖν =
to make a vibrating sound, see Bury on
Pind. Nem. 7. 80.</p>
<p>283f. Rossbach proposes ἄφραστον

say whether this word or τροχώδης was
the gloss (see cr. n.).—κατερρικνωμένος :
shrivelled. Cf. Callim. fr. 49 ναὶ μὰ τὸ
ῥικνὸν | σῦφαρ ἐμόν. Hunt renders it
'curved,' but see Suid. ς.υ. κατερρικνωμένον.
συνεστραμμένον, κάμπυλον γενόμενον,
ἐρρυτιδωμένον, where the last gloss applies
to the present passage. Fr. 316
should not be taken to be a reference to
this line.</p>
<p>296 αἰέλουρος. The form is established
as Sophoclean by fr. 986.—τως here
clearly = ὡς. This may also be the case
in Aesch. Theb. 624, where the edd.
strive to construe it as thus. See also Ar.
Ach. 762, where the Megarian is speaking.
Stahl however corrects to χὡς.</p>
<p>298 See cr. n. The recovery of the
true reading makes it unnecessary to
consider Wilamowitz's ἰχνεύμων and
κάρκινος, which were adopted in both of
Hunt's editons: for the fact thatὡς
follows πέφυκεν (ἐστὶν...φυήν) in 296 and
300 shows that here also it is employed
in the same way : 'is he not then the
very image of an ichneumon?' I now
think (with Maas)that ἰχνευτής=ἰκνεύμων.
Certainly βραχυσκελές suits the ichneumon,
and γογγύλον might be explained by
Aelian's ἐγκυλίσας ἑαυτόν (nat. an. 3. 22).</p>

<p>‘Aetnaean beetle’ was the ludicrous
image of an unfamiliar object. See C.R.
xxviii 224. In regard to κεράστης Viljoen
answers that horned beetles are actually
found in Sicily. That is not surprising,
but what we are here concerned with is
the horned beetle fo the Aetnacan strain.
If the horned beetle is so much larger
than other species, how much more terrific
was the horned Aetnaean beetle which
could speak after death.—Cyllene gravely
assents: for  ἐγγύς see on fr. 210, 38.</p>
<p>303 ορίνη. if this is a compound
of ῥινός. cf. κελαινόρινος (κελαινόρινες fr.
29 n.), κοσκινόρινος, and for the feminine
termination supr. 168. ὀρεινή, the original
reading, which seems to have been corrected,
would of course be a suitable
epithet of the tortoise (ὀπεσκῴοιο χελώης
h. Herm. 42). For ὀστράκων cf. h. Herm.
32 πόθεν τόδε καλὸν ἄθυρμα | αἰόλον ὅστρακον
ἔσσο; Wilamowitz thought that the
reading of the papyrus was a fusion of
ὀστράκων and ὀστρέων.</p>
<p>306 Mekler pointed out that ἤσυχος
and its oblique cases were equally unsuitable
to the gap. If η is rightly read
it must apparently be the disjunctive ἤ,
and we might conjecture πῶς δ᾿ ἀν γένοιτο
φίλτερον τὸ κτέανον ἣ σῦρίγξ τινι; In that
case, we should have to suppose that the
stichomythia ends with thisquestion, which
gives occasion for a description by Cyllene
of the remarkable qualities of the lyre.</p>
<p>307 δέρμα is no doubt the hide of
the oxen : cf. 337 ff., 366, It has been
that Apollodorus represents the ox-hide
as used for the construction of the strings.
Sophocles clearly gave a different account,
but the verses of the Homeric hymn
(47 ff.), which he probably intended to
follow, are unfortunately disputed : πῆξε
δ᾿ ἄρ᾿ ἐν μέτροισι ταμὼν δόνακας καλάμοιο,
| πειρήνας διὰ νῶτα διὰ ῥινοῖο χελώνης,
| ἀμφὶ δὲ δέρμα τάνυσσε βοὸς πραπίδεσσιν
ἐῇσι. On this Allen and Sikes write :
‘the reeds were cut in diffent legths,
and fixed in the shell; they thus served
as a framework for the ox-hide which
was stretched over them, to form a
sounding-board.’ I see nothing in the
mutilated text of Sophocles, which prevents
us from supposing that he interpreted
Homer in this way; but Robert
(p. 557) insists that the fret or bridge (cf.
fr. 36 n.), the yoke, and the πήχεις were
all denominated δόνακες, and that the
ox-hide was especially employed ‘to cover
the ends of the bridgs so as to keep it
fast and prevent displacement.’ Schenkl,
who lays stress on the interpretation of
κόλλοψ in Eustath. Od. p. 1915, 7, holds
that fresh ox-hide was wrapped round the
lower fret chiefty to prevent drying and
cracking. and that this process was
described in 312 f.—δέρμα καὶ στέγος φέρει,
Viljoen. Wilamowitz suggests κῶστρακον
to follow δέρμα.</p>
<p>308 κλαγγάνει : cf. fr. 959.</p>
<p>309 Schenkl completes the line by
adapting the corrupt fr. 315 so as to
run: ἐνήλατα ξύλ᾿ ὠς τρίγομφα διατόρως
ἐρείδεται. This is very ingenious, and
he is entitled to appeal to the aptness
of the comparison between the structure
of the lyre and the framework of a bed.
But, even after the necessary changes
introduced by Schenkl, the words do not
seem to cohere with the previous line.</p>

of heart | fall asleep, or, hearing, die.—
ἄκεστρον: fr. 480.—παραψυκτήριον is
a word hitherto unrecorded.—ἀλύων.
The unfamiliar sound is regarded as
a sign of distraction. For the fact see
h. Herm. 53 πλήκτρῳ ἐπειρήτιζε κατὰ μέρος,
ἢ δ᾿ ὑπὸ χειρὸς | σμερδαλέον κονάβησε·
θεὸς δ᾿ ὑπὸ καλὸν ἄειδεν | ἐξ αὐτοσχεδίης
πειρώμενος. Observe that μόνον, 'he has
nothing else to comfort him,' prepares
the way for ἀλύων ('he is crazy with
delight'), which in its turn is justified
by ἐξαίρει. Cf. Bekk. anecd. p. 380, 20,
giving ἐπαίρεσθαι καὶ χαίρειν as a gloss on
Hom. σ 333. There is thus no need for
Bucherer's ἀθύρων.</p>
<p>319 ἐξαίρει, elates. Cf. El. 1460 εἴ

is to be found in Eur. Alc. 346 οὔτ᾿ ἂν

<p>321 The short ode which begins
here corresponds metrically to 362 ff.
The metre is similar to 237 ff.—ὀρθοψάλακτος,
'loud': cf. 249. οψαλακτος
(see cr. n.) is meaningless, and 362 indicastes
that one extra syllable is required,
so that I follow Hunt in adopting Murray's
conjecture, but without much confidence
that it is right. Wilamowitz does not
explain his ἀπροψάλακτος, which, though
presumably based on προψαλάσσω (241),
is by no means perspicuous. Since ψαλάσσω
was unquestionaly used for
twanging the lyre (Lycophr. 139 τοίγαρ
ψαλάξεις εἰς κενὸν νευρᾶς κτύπον, | ἄσιτα
κἀδώρητα φορμίζων μέλη), this meaning
must surely have been the chief element
in the compound (perhaps ἀποψάλακτος
after Philostr. vit. soph. 2. I. 14 ἡ γλῶττα
τὴν ἄκραν Ἀτθίδα ἀποψάλλει).—κατοιχπεδίων
τόπου. The genitive resembles
πεδίων ἐπινίσσεται O.C. 689. It is descended from the old (partitive) genitive</p>

with φάσματα is supported by
Hesych. III p. 369 πρεπτά· φαντάσματα,
εἰκόνες, which, as Wilamowitz suggests,
may relate to this particular passage.
Hunt gives two versions: (I) ‘the song
plucks local images.’ Or (2) with ἐπανθεμίζει
intransitive : ‘fantasies flit over
the scene,’ like a bird or bee from flower
to flower. I prefer the latter alternative
and take Theon's variant, which is
against the metre, to be an acknowledgment
of the intransitive use of
ἐπανθεμίζει. But I should prefer to
render : ‘visions revealed by the straining
chords are spread around us (ἕγχωρα,
predicative) like a carpet of flowers,
Similarly in Aesch. Cho. 150, where
ἐπανθίζειν ‘to make to blossom’ is transitive,
there is the same comparison of
sound to flowers. The variegated ποικιλία
of the lyre (319) is expressed as ἄνθεμα.
For the τόνος of the lyre (ἑπτάτονος) cf.
Ar. Eq. 532. Stahl. who thinks that
ἐπανθεμίζει must be transitive, makes ὀμφά
the subject, and reads ἔγχορδα for ἕψχωρα.</p>
<p>324 ff. On the assumption  that the
text is sound in the main, the baldness
of style and clumsiness of structure are
quite unlike Sophocles. Wilamowitz
gives up the first line as corrupt, and
holds that the sense required is τὸ πρᾶγμα
δ μετέρχομαι. Translate rather : ‘this is
the point to which I am gradually conducting
my search (τὸ πρᾶγμα = τὸ
χρῆμα in 223) : whoever be the god who
devided this trick, the thief is none
other than he, lady, you may be sure.’
(I) οἵπερ seems indispensable here, as in
Eur. Hel. 1670, since οὗπερ would be
scarcely intelligible. Where the verb is
in the perfect tense, as in Trach. 40, the
case may be different. (2) I understand
οἶπερ as having a personal reference, i.c.
to τὸν δαίμον᾿ in the following clause. See
on fr. 191 and cf. Hdt. 9. 1 ὅκου δὲ ἑκάστοτε
γένοιτο, τούτους παρελάμβανε, Phil.
456 ff., and for the relative clause put first
Kuehner-Gerth II 420 Anm. 2. The extraordinary
circumlocutions are due to the
chorus being afraid to come to the point
(cf. 328 f.). (3) τὸν δαίμον᾿ is an anticipated
accusative, but instead of being resumed
as the subject (or object) of a subordinate
clause, ἐκείνου takes its place.
So El. 1366. For a similar looseness of
connexion see on Eur. Phoen. 101. (4) Instead 
of the subordinate clause for which
we are looking, there follows what now
becomes the main sentence, as if ἵσθι
as σάφ᾿ ἵσθι which follows (O.T. 1022,
1117, fr. 282 n.). (5) ὅστις ποθ᾿ ὅς, is
strangely substituted for ὄστις ποτ᾿ ἢν ὅς,
which is itself an unusual amplification of
ὅστις. In O.T. 1349 ὄλοιθ᾿ ὄστις ἢν ὅς κτἐ,
Hermann cut out ἣν. O.T. 373 οὐδεὶς δς
οὐχί κτὲ.—ἄλλος...ἀντ᾿ ἐκείνου: for the
pleonasm see on Eur. Hel. 574, Starkie
on Ar. Nub. 653.</p>
<p>For Hermes in the character of a thief
cf. Cornut. 16 p. 25, 13 Lang κλέπτην
αὐτὸν παρέδωκαν. The evidence is collected
by Gruppe, Gr. Myth p. 1338,
and by Eitrem in Pauly-Wissowa VIII 780,</p>
<p>Stahl, reading οὖ πέρι προνεύω, with
ὡτ for ὅτ and τοῦτ᾿ for ταῦτ᾿, makes τὸ
πρᾶγμα the anticipated object of ἐτεχνήσατο,
with ὡς following ἴσθι.</p>
<p>329 See cr. n. Wilamowitz thinks
that this and the preceding line are not

<p>catalectic closing the preceding acatalectic 
series. The text is unfortunately defective 
at 359, where it might have decided 
the question. — δυσφορηθῇς implies συσφορεῖσθαι, 
of which there is no trace 
except as a variant in Xen. Cyr. 2. 2. 5. 
For the passive form of the aorist see on 
frs. 164, 837.</p>
<p>331 χειμάζειν, to annoy, vex, distress, 
— in a less severe sense than in 267 (n.). 
The use seems to have been colloquial (cf. 
Ant. 391), and is glossed with ἐνοχλεῖν 
by Amnion, p. 146, quoting Menander ἐν
Ἡνιόχῳ (fr. 208, III 60 K.). Cf. fr. 404,

<p>332 Mekler’s supplement is slightly 
preferable to Hunt's μῶν τὸν Διὸς παῖδ᾿ 
ὄντα.—φηλήτην: see cr. n. and fr. 933 n.
Maas (B. ph. W. 1912, 1076) reverts to
the form φιλήτης, on the ground that it 
is also supported by the wooden tablet of 
the Hecate, and by the papyrus of Hellanicus 
(ΟΧ. Pap. 1084. 3). It is certainly 
remarkable that the text of Hellanicus by 
affirming the derivation from φιλεῖν seems 
to indicate that he employed φιλήτης, but 
we cannot feel certain that the statement
really goes back to the supposed original,
For a similar error see 358 and fr. 171
(ψιλαφᾷ for ψηλαφᾷ). The word was
particularly associated with Hermes from
the Homeric hymn (292, 446) onwards.
Besides Hellanicus, see Eur. Rhes. 217

<p>333 κλοπῇ. Hunt thinks this is
concrete as in Eur. Hel. 1675 (= thing
stolen), and suggests ὅν γ᾿ ἐντυχὼν λάβοιμ᾿ 
ἄν. But we might as well have καὶ γὰρ
δοκεῖ λαθεῖν ἄν — for all his thievery (cf.
162). For the metre see p. 230.</p>
<p>344 f. The gaps are well filled by
Mekler with πονηρέ σ᾿ ἐγχάσκοντα and
δρᾷς δ᾿ ὑγιὲς οὐδέν. He supposes that
a new sentence begins with ἄρτι in 343.</p>

<p>350 μὴ βλάπτε κινῶν. I have preferred
this to ’s μὴ σκῶπτε ποιῶν,
because to accuse a god of theft is fitly
described as an injurious slander, and
κινῶν is somewhat more apt (see Blaydcs
on Ar. Sub. 1397) than ποιῶν. ’Stirring
up a new charge against a new-born

<p>ἤλυθες ἡμετέρους. The correction εἶ σύ
seems inevitable; but Wilamowitz, who
insists that Silenus is still on the stage
and must be the person addressed, makes
the violent alteration of νέος to πάλαι.
Hunt has shown that the young satyrs
are often represented as bald-headed and
that the taunt may be quite well addressed
to the chorus. Cf. Eur. Cycl. 434 νεανίας
γὰρ εἶ.</p>
<p>359 Hunt renders ’cease courting
pleasure with your bald pate,’ but does
not explain the peculiarity of the language.
No satisfactory result can be deduced
from the interpretation of πιτνάς either
as spreading ox strewing (Hes. Scut. 291).
It is suggested, therefore, that πίτνημι is
used here in the figurative sense of to flutter
or excite, a meaning which is perhaps
justified by Horn. σ 160 ὅπως πετάσειε
μάλιστα | θυμὸν μνηστήρων, and by φρένας
ἐκπεπετασμένος if that is read ib. 327.</p>
<p>360f. See cr. n. ’Take care that
the ’t punish your foolish jests,
and give me cause to laugh at the tears
that will ’ The order of the words
shows that considerable stress is laid on
ἐκ θεῶν, for which see 11. on fr. 326. The
final clause ὡς ἐγὼ γελῶ ironically represents
the natural result of an action as
the purpose οἱ the agent. Cf. e.g. Horn.
B 359, ἁπτέσθω ἧς νηὸς . . . ὄφρα πρόσθ᾿
ἄλλων θάνατον καὶ πότμον ἐπίσπη. The
addition of σ᾿ improves the antithesis,
and is scarcely a ponderable alteration.
Hunt, putting a question after ὕστερ᾿,
reads ὣς ἐγὼ λέγω, and suggests that
σ’ should be added aftr κλαίειν. Wila-
mowitz alters ἐκ θεῶν to εἰς θεούς, and
ends the sentence with ὑστέρως, ἐγὼ λέγω
(coll. Eur. fr. 499). For the adverbial
ace. ὕστερα see Kuehner-Gerth 1 310.</p>
<p>362 στρέφου, shuffle, recalls Ar.
Ach. 385 ’s n.).</p>
<p>363 f. ἀπόψηκτον: wiped clean, and
so, keen-scented, sharp, acute. The best
illustration of the metaphor is Hor. Sat.
1. 4. 8 emunctae naris (of Lucilius). Cf.
Lucian navig. 45 καίτοι ἑνὸς τοῦ ἀναγκαιοτάτου
προσδεῖ, ὃς περιθέμενόν σε παύσει

ἀποξύσας. Plat. rep. 343 A κορυζῶντα
περιορᾷ καὶ οὐκ ἀπομύττει δεόμενον.
Hunt, however, prefers to understand
the word, which does not occur elsewhere,
as equivalent to ’ ’
i.e. elaborate; and Wilamowitz gives it
an active —removing suspicion, exculpatory.

but it is difficult to complete the line,
unless the speech of the chorus extended
beyond a single verse.</p>
<p>414 For the palaeographical data
bearing on the position of this column
see ’s note.</p>
<p>431 ff. The remains of Col. xvii
appear to belong to a scene in which
Apollo had returned to the stage, and
had learnt from the chorus of the success
of their search. Consequently he tells
them that they have earned their rewards.
Probably Silenus also reappeared at this
point, whereas Cyllene had retired discomfited.
We might suggest that the
suspicions of the chorus had been con-
firmed by some visual evidence, which
prepared the way for their triumph.
Hunt concludes that a single column has
been lost between 394 and 431, and so
much space at least seems to be required.</p>

πόδα κλίνης· ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐνείρεσθαι τῷ ἐνηλάτῳ.
Phryn: (CLN R.) states that κραστήρια
is the correct Attic term for ἑνήλατα, but
there is no material to test his authority,
i meaning is placed beyond doubt by
in Pauly-Wssowa til 370. The interpretation
of τρίγομφα and διατορεῦσαι is
doubtful; I mt I think it is possible to
get nearer to the truth. (1) The sense
usually given to τρίγομφα, ‘fatened with
three nails,’ is absurd. I should
suppose that it means ’firmly-bolted,’
and that rpi- has the same force as in τριγέρων,
τρίδουλος, τριπάλαι, τριπανοῦργος,
τρισάθλιος and many ὁ (2) διατορεῦσαι
is not to bort through, but to
engrave, chase; and, although it may be
an error for διατορῆσαι or διατορεῖν σε,
the corruption is not likely. On the other
hand, the context does not sugge-t an
allusion to τορευτική; for although the
bedstead of Odysseus was adorned with
gold, silver and ivory (Hon. ψ 200), the
virh required here must have been appropriate
to ξύλα. Put τορεύειν and its
cognates are constantly confused with
τορνεύειν etc.; and διατορνεύειν, to finish
off with the lathe, is exactly what we
want Γ 391). I suggest, therefore,
that we should read something like
ξύλα | ἐνηλάτων τρίγομφα διατορνεύσεως
δεῖται, or pei haps simply διατορνεύσεται.
In Aclian NT. hist. 14. 7 perhaps διατορνευθέντες
would be an improvcm
διατορευθέντες (cf. ἀποτορνεύω). I find
that iilaydcs has suggested ἐνήλατ᾿ οὖν
τρίγομφα τορνεῦσαί σε δεῖ, besides alternatives;
and llerwerdcn ἐνήλατα
νῶν&#x003E; τρίγομφα &#x003C;πολλὰ&#x003E;
δεῖ. R. Kllis conjectured διατόρευτ᾿ ἀποξῦσαί
σε δεῖ. It should be added that
Robert guesses that Hermes pad
cealed the lyre in his mother's bed,
that we should read δεῖ τρίγομφ᾿ ἐνήλατα
| &#x003C;νῦν&#x003E; διατορεῦσαι (? διατορῆσαι) σ᾿.
if the facts were as supposed, the
method proposed for discovering the lost
would be a very strain.
